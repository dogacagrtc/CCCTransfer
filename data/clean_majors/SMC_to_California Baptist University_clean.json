Only coursework completed with a grade of C- or better will be accepted in transfer. Lower division units and units from institutions that do not offer a baccalaureate degree will not be accepted for upper division credit. California Baptist University does not accept transfer work that was not designated as baccalaureate degree-applicable by the issuing institution.</p><p><br></p><p>All coursework completed at other institutions will be computed into the California Baptist University cumulative grade point average regardless of course transferability.</p>",
        "<p>The General Education curriculum consists of 40-55 units of coursework designed to provide the student with a strong and diverse academic preparation. In keeping with the ideal of a liberal arts education, the general education curriculum provides students with a broad exposure to the world of ideas and the arts to secure a foundation for students to successfully move into their major of study. In addition, a decidedly Christian perspective is integrated into the requirements and afford the student an opportunity to develop a Christian worldview.</p>",

Only coursework completed with a grade of C- or better will be accepted in transfer. Lower division units and units from institutions that do not offer a baccalaureate degree will not be accepted for upper division credit. California Baptist University does not accept transfer work that was not designated as baccalaureate degree-applicable by the issuing institution.</p><p><br></p><p>All coursework completed at other institutions will be computed into the California Baptist University cumulative grade point average regardless of course transferability.</p>",

In keeping with the ideal of a liberal arts education, the general education curriculum provides students with a broad exposure to the world of ideas and the arts to secure a foundation for students to successfully move into their major of study. In addition, a decidedly Christian perspective is integrated into the requirements and afford the student an opportunity to develop a Christian worldview.</p>",

Only coursework completed with a grade of C- or better will be accepted in transfer. Lower division units and units from institutions that do not offer a baccalaureate degree will not be accepted for upper division credit. California Baptist University does not accept transfer work that was not designated as baccalaureate degree-applicable by the issuing institution.</p><p><br></p><p>All coursework completed at other institutions will be computed into the California Baptist University cumulative grade point average regardless of course transferability.</p>",

Only coursework completed with a grade of C- or better will be accepted in transfer. Lower division units and units from institutions that do not offer a baccalaureate degree will not be accepted for upper division credit. California Baptist University does not accept transfer work that was not designated as baccalaureate degree-applicable by the issuing institution.</p><p><br></p><p>All coursework completed at other institutions will be computed into the California Baptist University cumulative grade point average regardless of course transferability.</p>",

In keeping with the ideal of a liberal arts education, the general education curriculum provides students with a broad exposure to the world of ideas and the arts to secure a foundation for students to successfully move into their major of study. In addition, a decidedly Christian perspective is integrated into the requirements and afford the student an opportunity to develop a Christian worldview.</p>",

California Baptist University does not accept transfer work that was not designated as baccalaureate degree-applicable by the issuing institution.</p><p><br></p><p>All coursework completed at other institutions will be computed into the California Baptist University cumulative grade point average regardless of course transferability.</p>",
