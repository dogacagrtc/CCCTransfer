Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely.

Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver.

American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver.

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

Major requirements for the first two years of study for BA Art/Studio Practice and all BFA degrees are very similar so that students have time to choose the right path and can apply for the BFA, if they choose to do so.&nbsp;At the time BFA program applicants must meet the following departmental requirements:</span></p><p><br></p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Have completed, be currently enrolled in, or planning to enroll within the following two semesters in all coursework in the common preparation for the BA and BFA Art majors (25-28 units of drawing, digital media, photography, sculpture, art history, ART 1, ART 2, ART 3 and ART 100W) with a minimum grade point average of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.&nbsp;Also recommend, are three to six additional units from the desired BFA concentration area.</span></li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Pass the BFA – Art admissions review.&nbsp;During the review, which is held in October and March of each year, images of the applicant’s creative work are reviewed by the art faculty to determine if the work demonstrates the creative level expected of BFA candidates.

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5.

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver.

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3.

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver.

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

Students' goals will determine whether they opt for the BS or BA degree, with possible specialization in biochemistry. Students who transfer into these programs should be aware that general chemistry and a number of preparation courses, especially the mathematics and physics requirements, should be started during their first two years. If students transfer at the junior level without most of these courses completed, more than four semesters at SJSU may be required to complete the degree.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">All chemistry majors must meet with their advisors every semester.

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

Students' goals will determine whether they opt for the BS or BA degree, with possible specialization in biochemistry. Students who transfer into these programs should be aware that general chemistry and a number of preparation courses, especially the mathematics and physics requirements, should be started during their first two years. If students transfer at the junior level without most of these courses completed, more than four semesters at SJSU may be required to complete the degree.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">All chemistry majors must meet with their advisors every semester.

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5.

For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",
        "<p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">This major is designed for students interested in teaching in elementary school or middle school. The following course work satisfies San Jose State University’s requirements for the BA in Child and Adolescent Development (CHAD).

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5.

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely.

Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5.

For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely.

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely.

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3).

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver.

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>"

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely.

Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3).

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>Admission to San José State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this, SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs. For the most current information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/transfer-impaction-results/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Admissions Impaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to transferring to San José State University all transfers must earn at least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have an approved CSU GE 1B waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units, students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):</strong> Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU GE 34 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for this major are shown below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. General Education (GE) Requirements:</strong> Complete all the CSU GE requirements at the community. The approved courses for each area can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link for your college. Many of these courses may be double counted to meet the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the <a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a> page in our catalog. Please see your college counselor or advisor to review your general education requirements before transferring to San José State University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended</strong>: All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either to meet CSU GE Area 1B or 3B).&nbsp;Complete this course with a grade of “C-” or better for the greatest success in passing a Writing in the Disciplines (100W) course with a “C” or better (C- not accepted) at SJSU.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):</strong> This requirement is normally two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU GE requirements (Area 4 and sometimes Area 3). The approved courses can be found at <a href=\"https://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASSIST.org</a> under the link \"CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses\" for your college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):</strong> All undergraduate students who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an approved PE waiver. Majors which have approved PE waivers are noted on the \"<a href=\"https://catalog.sjsu.edu/content.php?catoid=17&amp;navoid=7645\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Exceptions for University Graduation Requirements</a>\" page in our catalog.</p><p><br></p>",
