        "<p>Admission to the UC Berkeley <strong>College of Engineering</strong> is highly competitive.</p><p><br></p><p>Application for junior transfer admissions to the <strong>Aerospace Engineering</strong> major will open in 2023-24 for admission in fall 2024. Applicants to the Aerospace Engineering major must complete all required core UCB preparation courses in order to be eligible for admission. Only applicants who have completed 100% of these required courses will be considered for admission. Required courses for admission to the major must be completed by the end of the spring semester prior to fall enrollment. <strong>A summer 2026 course is not considered to be \"work in progress\" for the fall 2026 selection process.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103=Chemistry A and B), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion (e.g., 2 of the 3 required courses) will result in zero credit toward the requirement(s), and the applicant will <strong>NOT </strong>be considered for admission. The only exception to the series rule is Math 54. If Math 54 is split into two different courses, one covering linear algebra and one covering differential equations, we strongly encourage applicants to take both courses at the same community college; however, the College of Engineering will accept linear algebra from one school and differential equations from a different school.</p><p><br></p><p>Lower division UC Berkeley courses required for graduation (but not admission) are also listed in the major agreements and are strongly recommended to be taken to strengthen one's application. The more of these courses completed, the stronger the application will be.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Required core courses for admission: (all these courses must be completed to be considered for admission)</strong></p><p>- UCB MATH 51; 52; 53; 54</p><p>- UCB PHYSICS 7A; 7B</p><p>- One from UCB: ASTRON 7A; 10; BIOLOGY 1A/1AL; 1B; CHEM 1A/AL; 1B; 3A/3AL; 3B/3BL; MCELLBI 32; PHYSICS 7C</p><p>- UCB READING AND COMPOSITION A; B</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Strongly recommended courses: (if your college offers the courses listed below and they are articulated, taking them will strengthen your application)</strong> If no articulation exists, students are strongly encouraged to take a course in SolidWorks and a course in Computer Programming.</p><p>- UCB ENGIN 7 or COMPSCI 61A</p><p>- UCB MAT SCI 45/45L</p><p>- UCB MEC ENG 40 or ENGIN 40</p><p>- UCB MEC ENG C85/CIV ENG C30</p><p><br></p><p>Admission is primarily based on the completeness of the applicant's lower division preparation and the level of academic achievement reflected in the student's grade point average. The UC applicant essay also plays an important role in the selection process at UC Berkeley. The College reviews the essay for evidence of interest in the student's chosen field and a thoughtful match between the academic program and the student's academic and career objectives.</p><p><br></p><p>The College of Engineering requires six humanities/social science courses, two of which must be reading and composition. The only non-technical admission requirement for the College of Engineering is the coursework equivalent to UC Berkeley's Reading and Compostion A and B, which must be taken for a letter grade. The College of Engineering <strong>does not recognize the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (Cal-GETC/IGETC) and strongly discourages students</strong> from following this option due to the number of major-specific technical courses required for engineering transfer admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Reading and Compostion requirements <u>cannot </u>be satisfied by Cal-GETC/IGETC; applicants must complete the specific courses indicated as Reading and Composition A and B equivalents to be considered for admission. Failure to complete the exact courses listed will mean the applicant will NOT be considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p>The remaining four humanities/social science requirement courses are not considered for admission purposes but are required for graduation. See <a href=\"http://coe.berkeley.edu/hssreq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hss</a> for the College of Engineering humanities/social science breadth requirements and courses. Courses which are three semester units or more that appear in the following categories on the \"General Education/Breadth\" section of <a href=\"http://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assist.org</a> may be used to satisfy <strong>two of</strong> the remaining four humanities/social science course requirements for the College of Engineering. ARTS AND LITERATURE; HISTORICAL STUDIES; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES; PHILOSOPHY AND VALUES; SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. Additionally, courses that teach a foreign language may be used to satisfy this requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>SAT/ACT/A-level test scores and letters of recommendation are NOT considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE: ALL REQUIRED COURSES AND ALL STRONGLY RECOMMENDED COURSES FOR THE MAJOR MUST BE TAKEN FOR A LETTER GRADE.

        "<p><strong>Preparing for the Ancient Greek and Roman Studies Major</strong></p><p>Ancient Greek and Roman Studies (AGRS) is an interdisciplinary \"area studies\" major. It provides students with the opportunity to explore the rich diversity of Mediterranean antiquity in depth, alongside a relatively small cohort of undergraduates. While language study is an option, the major may be completed entirely in English. This major provides excellent preparation for various careers, including law, medicine, teaching, writing, and business, as well as for graduate study in fields such as Anthropology, Archaeology, History, and Art History.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Direct Admission</strong></p><p>If you are admitted to UC Berkeley intending to major in Ancient Greek and Roman Studies, you will be directly admitted into the major. This means you do not need to apply or declare the major separately after admission.</p><p><br></p><p>To ensure a smooth transition and help you plan your coursework effectively, all admitted transfer students are required to meet with our undergraduate advisor shortly after admission. This meeting will help you develop a program plan to complete your major requirements and stay on track for graduation. You will receive information on how to schedule this meeting, either through Golden Bear Advising program or an email from the advisor, before the start of your first semester..</p><p><br></p>",

        "<p>This major is offered by the College of Environmental Design (CED).</p><p><br></p><p>The undergraduate program in <strong>Architecture </strong>leads to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. Through its core courses, the program offers a broad introduction to the field of architecture, and through studies in the various areas it provides opportunities to prepare for specialization in the field in the areas of architectural design and representation, architectural technologies and building performance, architectural history, society and culture. In addition to offering a sound and well-rounded education, undergraduate studies can also provide pre-professional competency for entry-level employment in architecture, the option for graduate work in architecture, or further studies in a related environmental design field.</p><p><br></p><p>Many graduates go on to obtain Master of Architecture or related degrees; others work in architectural offices, construction, government, or industry. Employment opportunities exist also at the community level, particularly in those communities which traditionally have not been served by professional architectural practice. The overall aim of the undergraduate program is to establish a strong foundation for a diversity of careers and to provide for mobility and flexibility to suit changing individual opportunities.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Accreditation and Licensing</strong>. The BA degree is a pre-professional degree and provides the foundation for entry to a Master of Architecture program, the most widespread professional degree program in Architecture in the US. The BA degree can also be applied toward licensing requirements in the State of California. See the National Architectural Accrediting Board <a href=\"http://naab.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">naab.org</a> for more information on accreditation. See the California Architect’s Board <a href=\"http://cab.ca.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cab.ca.gov</a> and the National Council of Architectural Registration Board <a href=\"http://www.ncarb.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.ncarb.org</a> for more information on licensing.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION </u></strong></p><p><br></p><p>For information about admission to the Architecture major in the College of Environmental Design, see CED's prospective student website: <a href=\"http://ced.berkeley.edu/admissions/undergraduate/transfer-applicants/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://ced.berkeley.edu/admissions/undergraduate/transfer-applicants/</a></p><p><br></p><p>-The personal insight questions section on the UC application is important in the selection process at Berkeley.

        "<p>Admission to the UC Berkeley<strong> College of Engineering </strong>is highly competitive.</p><p><br></p><p>Applicants to the <strong>Bioengineering </strong>major must complete all required core UCB preparation courses in order to be eligible for admission. Only applicants who have completed 100% of these required courses will be considered for admission. Required courses for admission to the major must be completed by the end of the spring semester prior to fall enrollment. <strong>A summer 2026 course is not considered to be \"work in progress\" for the fall 2026 selection process.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103=Chemistry A and B), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion (e.g., 2 of the 3 required courses) will result in zero credit toward the requirement(s), and the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The only exception to the series rule is Math 54. If Math 54 is split into two different courses, one covering linear algebra and one covering differential equations, we strongly encourage applicants to take both courses at the same community college; however, the College of Engineering will accept linear algebra from one school and differential equations from a different school.</p><p><br></p><p>Lower division UC Berkeley courses required for graduation (but not admission) are also listed in the major agreements and are strongly recommended to be taken to strengthen one's application. The more of these courses completed, the stronger the application will be.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Required core courses for admission: (all these courses must be completed to be considered for admission).</strong></p><p>- UCB CHEM 1A/1AL; 3A/3AL</p><p>- UCB MATH 51; 52; 53; 54</p><p>- UCB PHYSICS 7A; 7B</p><p>- UCB READING AND COMPOSITION A; B</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Strongly recommended courses: (if your college offers the courses listed below and they are articulated, taking them will strengthen your application) If no articulation, students are strongly encouraged to take a course in electronics or circuits AND a course in programming.</strong></p><p>- UCB ENGIN 7 or COMPSCI 61A</p><p>- UCB EECS 16A</p><p>- UCB COMPSCI 61B</p><p>- UCB COMPSCI C8</p><p>- UCB MAT SCI 45/45L</p><p>- UCB COMPSCI 70</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Articulation subject to completion of a university course</strong></p><p>If the above statement is indicated under any of the community college course listed below, you will be required to take an additional course at UC Berkeley in order to complete the requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>Consult the Bioengineering website for which courses above would best match the sample track you wish to pursue. <a href=\"http://bioeng.berkeley.edu/undergrad\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://bioeng.berkeley.edu/undergrad</a></p><p><br></p><p>Admission is primarily based on the completeness of the applicant's lower division preparation and the level of academic achievement reflected in the student's grade point average. The UC applicant essay also plays an important role in the selection process at UC Berkeley. The College reviews the essay for evidence of interest in the student's chosen field and a thoughtful match between the academic program and the student's academic and career objectives.</p><p><br></p><p>The College of Engineering requires six humanities/social science courses, two of which must be reading and composition. The only non-technical admission requirement for the College of Engineering is the coursework equivalent to UC Berkeley's Reading and Composition A and B, which must be taken for a letter grade. The College of Engineering <strong>does not recognize the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (Cal-GETC/IGETC) and strongly discourages</strong> students from following this option due to the number of major-specific technical courses required for engineering transfer admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Reading and Composition requirements <u>cannot </u>be satisfied by Cal-GETC/IGETC; applicants must complete the specific courses indicated as Reading and Composition A and B equivalents to be considered for admission. Failure to complete the exact courses listed will mean the applicant will NOT be considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p>The remaining four humanities/social science requirement courses are not considered for admission purposes but are required for graduation. See <a href=\"http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hssreq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hss</a> for the College of Engineering humanities/social science breadth requirements and courses. Courses which are three semester units or more that appear in the following categories on the \"General Education/Breadth\" section of <a href=\"http://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assist.org</a> may be used to satisfy <strong>two of</strong> the remaining four humanities/social science course requirements for the College of Engineering. ARTS AND LITERATURE; HISTORICAL STUDIES; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES; PHILOSOPHY AND VALUES; SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. Additionally, courses that teach a foreign language may be used to satisfy this requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>SAT/ACT/A-level test scores and letters of recommendation are NOT considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE: ALL REQUIRED COURSES AND ALL STRONGLY RECOMMENDED COURSES FOR THE MAJOR MUST BE TAKEN FOR A LETTER GRADE.

Degree in Chemistry</strong> is offered by the <strong>College of Chemistry</strong>. The <strong>B.S.</strong> degree is intended for students who are primarily interested in careers as professional chemists or desire a thorough grounding in chemistry in preparation for professional or graduate school in chemistry and other disciplines. In addition, there are two concentrations available to Chemistry majors: 1) the Materials Chemistry concentration, intended for students interested in the application of basic chemical principles to the discovery, design, and characterization of materials; and 2) the Computational Chemistry concentration, intended for students interested in the use of high-performance computing, rooted in basic physical and mathematical principles, to solve problems in modern chemistry.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Transfer applicants are expected to complete, at a minimum, coursework equivalent to Berkeley's: </strong></p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">CHEMISTRY 1A + 1AL + 1B + 3A + 3AL + 3B + 3BL</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">MATH 51+ 52 + 53</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">PHYSICS 7A</p><p class=\"ql-indent-1\">READING &amp; COMPOSITION A + READING &amp; COMPOSITION B</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Coursework must be completed by the end of the spring term preceding fall enrollment at Berkeley. </strong></p><p><br></p><p>IGETC/Cal-GETC is not required. Students who choose to complete the entire IGETC pattern by the end of the spring term preceding fall enrollment at Berkeley may use IGETC to fulfill the Reading and Composition and Language Other Than English (LOTE) Requirements. Students who choose to complete Cal-GETC may use this certification to fulfill the Reading and Composition requirement, however Cal-GETC will not satisfy Language Other than English (LOTE). It is highly recommended that students complete this requirement with directly articulated course work as noted under the Language Other Than English (LOTE) requirement -- See list of approved (FL-Foreign Language) courses below.</p><p><br></p><p>Lower division courses required for graduation (but not for admission) are also listed in this articulation agreement. Completion of those courses is strongly recommended in order to strengthen one's application. All major courses must be taken for a letter grade. High grades in major courses (B and A grades exclusively) are essential for applicants to be both competitive in the admissions process and to be adequately prepared to continue with junior year coursework at Berkeley.</p><p><br></p><p>The applicant's personal insight questions are important in the admissions process. The answers are reviewed for evidence of the student's interest in the chosen field and a thoughtful match between the intended major and academic and career objectives.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>For more information on College of Chemistry policies and degree programs: </strong></p><p><a href=\"https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/ugrad/degrees\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/ugrad/degrees</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>For more information on admission to UC Berkeley:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://admissions.berkeley.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://admissions.berkeley.edu</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>For more information on majors at UC Berkeley: </strong></p><p><a href=\"https://undergraduate.catalog.berkeley.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://undergraduate.catalog.berkeley.edu/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Additional questions about transferring to the College of Chemistry may be</strong></p><p><strong>addressed to:</strong></p><p>Jahzeel Flores Morales, Director of Undergraduate Student Services</p><p><a href=\"mailto:jahzeel@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">jahzeel@berkeley.edu</a></p><p>(510) 643-0550 </p>",

        "<p>The <strong>Chicano Studies</strong> major offers an interdisciplinary curriculum of academic study that critically examines the historical and contemporary experiences of people of Mexican descent in the context of American society and institutions; and studies particular aspects of Mexican history, culture and politics as they bear upon the Chicano community, past and present. Emphasis is given to the student developing a broad knowledge of the Chicano experience. thus, the major stresses the analysis of the interrelationships in the historical background, cultural patterns and artistic expression of the Chicano community in order to acquire a well-rounded, in-depth understanding of the contemporary interface between Chicanos and American society. In this connection, the major strives to incorporate various disciplines in its approach, such as political science, sociology, anthropology, history, literary criticism and art. Through the interdisciplinary nature of our curriculum, the major is aimed at preparing students for incorporation into the world of work and for a wide range of advanced graduate work and/or professional training in various fields.</p><p><br></p><p>Please consult with the Chicano Studies adviser regarding the use of courses taken at your community college for credit toward the major. Generally, some UC-transferable courses taken at your community college can in fact be used to meet certain components of the major requirements.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>For more information contact Major Advisors: </strong></p><p><br></p><p>Dewey St. Germaine</p><p>(510) 643-6420</p><p><a href=\"mailto:deweystg@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">deweystg@berkeley.edu</a></p><p><br></p><p>Laura Jimenez-Olvera</p><p>(510) 642-0243</p><p><a href=\"mailto:lauraj@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lauraj@berkeley.edu</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://ethnicstudies.berkeley.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://ethnicstudies.berkeley.edu/</a></p>"

        "<p>Admission to the UC Berkeley <strong>College of Engineering</strong> is highly competitive.</p><p><br></p><p>Applicants to the <strong>Civil Engineering</strong> major must complete all required core UCB preparation courses in order to be eligible for admission. Only applicants who have completed 100% of these required courses will be considered for admission. Required courses 6for admission to the major must be completed by the end of the spring semester prior to fall enrollment. <strong>A summer 2026 course is not considered to be \"work in progress\" for the fall 2026 selection process.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103 = Chemistry A and B), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion (e.g., 2 of the 3 required courses) will result in zero credit toward the requirement(s), and the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The only exception to the series rule is Math 54. If Math 54 is split into two different courses, one covering linear algebra and one covering differential equations, we strongly encourage applicants to take both courses at the same community college; however, the College of Engineering will accept linear algebra from one school and differential equations from a different school.</p><p><br></p><p>Lower division UC Berkeley courses required for graduation (but not admission) are also listed in the major agreements and are strongly recommended to be taken to strengthen one's application. The more of these courses completed, the stronger the application will be</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Required core courses for admission: (all these courses must be completed to be considered for admission)</strong></p><p>- UCB CHEM 1A</p><p>- UCB CHEM 1B or BIOLOGY 1B or CIV ENG 70 or PHYSICS 7C</p><p>- UCB MATH 51 52; 53; 54</p><p>- UCB PHYSICS 7A; 7B</p><p>- UCB READING AND COMPOSITION A; B</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Strongly recommended courses: (if your college offers the courses listed below and they are articulated, taking them will strengthen your application) If no articulation exists, students are strongly encouraged to take a course in Statics AND a course in Computer Programming.</strong></p><p>- UCB CIV ENG 11; C30; 60; 93</p><p>- UCB ENGIN 7</p><p>- UCB MEC ENG 40 or ENGIN 40</p><p>- UCB COMPSCI C8</p><p><br></p><p>Admission is primarily based on the completeness of the applicant's lower division preparation and the level of academic achievement reflected in the student's grade point average. The UC applicant essay also plays an important role in the selection process at UC Berkeley. The College reviews the essay for evidence of interest in the student's chosen field and a thoughtful match between the academic program and the student's academic and career objectives.</p><p><br></p><p>The College of Engineering requires six humanities/social science courses, two of which must be reading and composition. The only non-technical admission requirement for the College of Engineering is the coursework equivalent to UC Berkeley's Reading and Composition A and B, which must be taken for a letter grade. The College of Engineering <strong>does not recognize the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (Cal-GETC/IGETC) and strongly discourages</strong> students from following this option due to the number of major-specific technical courses required for engineering transfer admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Reading and Composition requirements <u>cannot </u>be satisfied by Cal-GETC/IGETC; applicants must complete the specific courses indicated as Reading and Composition A and B equivalents to be considered for admission. Failure to complete the exact courses listed will mean the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The remaining four humanities/social science requirement courses are not considered for admission purposes but are required for graduation. See <a href=\"http://coe.berkeley.edu/hssreq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hss</a> for the College of Engineering humanities/social science breadth requirements and courses. Courses which are three semester units or more that appear in the following categories on the \"General Education/Breadth\" section of <a href=\"http://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assist.org</a> may be used to satisfy <strong>two of </strong>the remaining four humanities/social science course requirements for the College of Engineering. ARTS AND LITERATURE; HISTORICAL STUDIES; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES; PHILOSOPHY AND VALUES; SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. Additionally, courses that teach a foreign language may be used to satisfy this requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>SAT/ACT/A-level test scores and letters of recommendation are NOT considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE: ALL REQUIRED COURSES AND ALL STRONGLY RECOMMENDED COURSES FOR THE MAJOR MUST BE TAKEN FOR A LETTER GRADE.

Comparative Literature majors take classes in our department and in other language/literature departments on campus.</p><p><br></p><p>Students of Comparative Literature:&nbsp;</p><p>- develop their ability to read literary texts responsibly and critically, including through the lenses of culture, language, and context;&nbsp;</p><p>- study one language literature in depth and another selectively;&nbsp;</p><p>- acquire a broader sense of literary history and of literary traditions than the study of a single literature could furnish;</p><p>- explore the connections between writing and other pursuits;&nbsp;</p><p>- acquaint themselves with some of the significant writings in theory of literature;&nbsp;</p><p>- prepare themselves for the methodical investigation of issues involving more than one literature, language, and/or culture.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Students interested in Comparative Literature <strong><u>must work in two languages</u></strong> and must complete language requirements prior to beginning study in another language. Second language work could be a second native or heritage language or a language studied prior to enrollment at Cal. It is possible to complete the degree in four semesters with only some prior language experience, however students should confirm language placement both with the Comparative Literature Undergraduate Major Advisor and with their intended language department. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a2tDQCHc_WRvmZpF838sX03KIW5lrv_4iE_0j37cWE0/edit?tab=t.0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">General language guidelines for Comparative Literature can be found here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DP8ruJQCA6j7hIhlO0vIUwJsUBsKkjbPDyh9sbTqT74/edit\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">document</a> describes the major requirements.

        "<p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>ABOUT THE CONSERVATION &amp; RESOURCE STUDIES MAJOR</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Conservation and Resource Studies (CRS) major is a self-designed interdisciplinary program for students interested in environmental issues and areas of interaction among natural resources, population, energy, technology, societal institutions, and cultural values. Students draw on the course offerings of the entire campus and appropriate community resources in the development of individual programs of study. The major’s orientation is toward flexibility and an individualized educational approach to understanding the structure and dynamic functions of complex environmental systems within our society and biosphere. It encourages interaction among students, faculty, and community. The major’s offerings are designed to help each student formulate an area of interest, but are not in any way meant to limit the range of options available.</p><p><br></p><p>For additional information, please contact the Conservation &amp; Resource Studies advisor at <a href=\"mailto:crs.emf.ugrad@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">crs.emf.ugrad@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Please Note: </strong>Applicants are expected to complete all required coursework by the end of the spring term prior to admission. Majors may allow one course pending in the summer term prior to admission if the major has more than five required courses and at least five courses of the required coursework have been completed; in this case, if a requirement includes both a lecture and lab, the lecture and lab together are treated as one course. Majors which require five or fewer required courses to transfer will not allow required coursework to be completed in the summer prior to admission. Please see the <a href=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/transfer-applicants\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rausser College of Natural Resources Transfer Applicants page</a> for individual requirements by major.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Conservation &amp; Resource Studies applicants have five or fewer required courses to complete prior to transfer and will not be allowed to complete a required course in the summer prior to admission.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>To ensure full articulation of transfer coursework: </strong>if a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103 = CHEM 1A/1AL + CHEM 1B at UC Berkeley), all of the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion of the series (e.g., two of the three required courses) may result in no credit toward the requirement(s), and splitting a series of courses between different community colleges is not guaranteed to satisfy the requirement. Courses taken out of series will be evaluated by college faculty during the transfer admissions process.

        "<p><strong><u>PREPARATION FOR TRANSFER AT THEJUNIOR LEVEL</u></strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Dutch Studies student is admitted to the major after having satisfied the language requirement (two semesters of college level Dutch -- Dutch 1 and Dutch 2, or comparable courses). </p><p>This can be done either by taking the elementary language courses or by passing a proficiency exam. Because the program is both specialized and broad, using a many-sided approach </p><p>to the subject, it is recommended that students have a strong preparation in a related discipline, so that the group major in Dutch Studies may constitute the focal point to a larger area of </p><p>interest. Suggested related fields of concentration are Comparative Literature, German, Spanish and Portuguese, History, History of Art, African-American Studies, Linguistics, South and</p><p>Southeast Asian Studies.

        "<p><strong>Please Note: </strong>Applicants are expected to complete all required coursework by the end of the spring term prior to admission. Majors may allow one course pending in the summer term prior to admission if the major has more than five required courses and at least five courses of the required coursework have been completed; in this case, if a requirement includes both a lecture and lab, the lecture and lab together are treated as one course. Majors which require five or fewer required courses to transfer will not allow required coursework to be completed in the summer prior to admission.

Partial completion of the series (e.g., two of the three required courses) may result in no credit toward the requirement(s), and splitting a series of courses between different community colleges is not guaranteed to satisfy the requirement. Courses taken out of series will be evaluated by college faculty during the transfer admissions process.

Required courses for admission to the major must be completed by the end of the spring semester prior to fall enrollment. <strong>A summer 2026 course is not considered to be \"work in progress\" for the fall 2026 selection process.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103 = Chemistry A and B), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion (e.g., 2 of the 3 required courses) will result in zero credit toward the requirement(s), and the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The only exception to the series rule is Math 54. If Math 54 is split into two different courses, one covering linear algebra and one covering differential equations, we strongly encourage applicants to take both courses at the same community college; however, the College of Engineering will accept linear algebra from one school and differential equations from a different school.</p><p><br></p><p>Lower division UC Berkeley courses required for graduation (but not admission) are also listed in the major agreements and are strongly recommended to be taken to strengthen one's application. The more of these courses completed, the stronger the application will be.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Required core courses for admission: (all these courses must be completed to be considered for admission)</strong></p><p>- UCB MATH 51; 52; 53; 54</p><p>- UCB PHYSICS 7A; 7B</p><p>- UCB READING AND COMPOSITION A; B</p><p>- One from UCB ASTRON 7A or 7B or BIOLOGY 1A/1AL or BIOLOGY 1B or CHEM 1A/1AL or CHEM 1B or CHEM 3A/3AL or CHEM 3B/3BL or MCELLBI 32/32L or PHYSICS 7C</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Strongly recommended courses: (if your college offers the courses listed below and they are articulated, taking them will strengthen your application)</strong> If no articulation, students are encouraged to take an introductory course in electronics or circuits AND courses in Java, C++ and Data Structures.</p><p>- UCB COMPSCI 61A; 61B; 61C; 70</p><p>- UCB EECS 16A; 16B</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Articulation subject to completion of a university course</strong></p><p>If the above statement is indicated under any of the community college courses listed below, you will be required to take an additional course at UC Berkeley in order to complete the requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>Admission is primarily based on the completeness of the applicant's lower division preparation and the level of academic achievement reflected in the student's grade point average. The UC applicant essay also plays an important role in the selection process at UC Berkeley. The College reviews the essay for evidence of interest in the student's chosen field and a thoughtful match between the academic program and the student's academic and career objectives.</p><p><br></p><p>The College of Engineering requires six humanities/social science courses, two of which must be reading and composition. The only non-technical admission requirement for the College of Engineering is the coursework equivalent to UC Berkeley's Reading and Composition requirement, which must be taken for a letter grade. The College of Engineering <strong>does not recognize the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (Cal-GETC/IGETC) and strongly discourages </strong>students from following this option due to the number of major-specific technical courses required for engineering transfer admission.</p><p><br></p><p>NOTE: The Reading and Composition requirements <u>cannot </u>be satisfied by Cal-GETC/IGETC; applicants must complete the specific courses indicated as Reading and Composition A and B equivalents to be considered for admission. Failure to complete the exact courses listed will mean the applicant will NOT be considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p>The remaining four humanities/social science requirement courses are not considered for admission purposes but are required for graduation. See <a href=\"http://coe.berkeley.edu/hssreq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hss</a> for the College of Engineering humanities/social science breadth requirements and courses. Courses which are three semester units or more that appear in the following categories on the \"General Education/Breadth\" section of <a href=\"http://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assist.org</a> may be used to satisfy <strong>two of</strong> the remaining four humanities/social science course requirements for the College of Engineering. ARTS AND LITERATURE; HISTORICAL STUDIES; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES; PHILOSOPHY AND VALUES; SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORIAL SCIENCES. Additionally, courses that teach a foreign language may be used to satisfy this requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>SAT/ACT/A-level test scores and letters of recommendation are NOT considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE: ALL REQUIRED COURSES AND ALL STRONGLY RECOMMENDED COURSES FOR THE MAJOR MUST BE TAKEN FOR A LETTER GRADE.

        "<p>Admission to the UC Berkeley <strong>College of Engineering</strong> is highly competitive.</p><p><br></p><p>Applicants to the <strong>Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences</strong> major must complete all required core UCB preparation courses in order to be eligible for admission. Only applicants who have completed 100% of these required courses will be considered for admission. Required courses for admission to the major must be completed by the end of the spring semester prior to fall enrollment. <strong>A summer 2026 course is not considered to be \"work in progress\" for the fall 2026 selection process.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103 = Chemistry A and B), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion (e.g., 2 of the 3 required courses) will result in zero credit toward the requirement(s), and the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The only exception to the series rule is Math 54. If Math 54 is split into two different courses, one covering linear algebra and one covering differential equations, we strongly encourage applicants to take both courses at the same community college; however, the College of Engineering will accept linear algebra from one school and differential equations from a different school.</p><p><br></p><p>Lower division UC Berkeley courses required for graduation (but not admission) are also listed in the major agreements and are strongly recommended to be taken to strengthen one's application. The more of these courses completed, the stronger the application will be.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Required core courses for admission: (all these courses must be completed to be considered for admission)</strong></p><p>- UCB MATH 51; 52; 53; 54</p><p>- UCB PHYSICS 7A; 7B</p><p>- UCB READING AND COMPOSITION A; B</p><p>- One from UCB ASTRON 7A or 7B or BIOLOGY 1A/1AL or BIOLOGY 1B or CHEM 1A/1AL or CHEM 1B or CHEM 3A/3AL or CHEM 3B/3BL or MCELLBI 32/32L or PHYSICS 7C</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Strongly recommended courses: (if your college offers the courses listed below and they are articulated, taking them will strengthen your application)</strong> If no articulation exists, students are encouraged to take an introductory course in electronics or circuits AND courses in Java, C++ and Data Structures.</p><p>- UCB COMPSCI 61A; 61B; 61C; 70</p><p>- UCB EECS 16A; 16B</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Articulation subject to completion of a university course</strong></p><p>If the above statement is indicated under any of the community college courses listed below, you will be required to take an additional course at UC Berkeley in order to complete the requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>Admission is primarily based on the completeness of the applicant's lower division preparation and the level of academic achievement reflected in the student's grade point average. The UC applicant essay also plays an important role in the selection process at UC Berkeley. The College reviews the essay for evidence of interest in the student's chosen field and a thoughtful match between the academic program and the student's academic and career objectives.</p><p><br></p><p>The College of Engineering requires six humanities/social science courses, two of which must be reading and composition. The only non-technical admission requirement for the College of Engineering is the coursework equivalent to UC Berkeley's Reading and Composition A and B requirement, which must be taken for a letter grade. The College of Engineering <strong>does not recognize the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (Cal-GETC/IGETC) and strongly discourages </strong>students from following this option due to the number of major-specific technical courses required for engineering transfer admission.</p><p><br></p><p>NOTE: The Reading and Composition requirements <u>cannot </u>be satisfied by Cal-GETC/IGETC; applicants must complete the specific courses indicated as Reading and Composition A and B equivalents to be considered for admission. Failure to complete the exact courses listed will mean the applicant will NOT be considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p>The remaining four humanities/social science requirement courses are not considered for admission purposes but are required for graduation. See <a href=\"http://coe.berkeley.edu/hssreq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hss</a> for the College of Engineering humanities/social science breadth requirements and courses. Courses which are three semester units or more that appear in the following categories on the \"General Education/Breadth\" section of <a href=\"http://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assist.org</a> may be used to satisfy <strong>two of</strong> the remaining four humanities/social science course requirements for the College of Engineering. ARTS AND LITERATURE; HISTORICAL STUDIES; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES; PHILOSOPHY AND VALUES; SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORIAL SCIENCES. Additionally, courses that teach a foreign language may be used to satisfy this requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>SAT/ACT/A-level test scores and letters of recommendation are NOT considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE: ALL REQUIRED COURSES AND ALL STRONGLY RECOMMENDED COURSES FOR THE MAJOR MUST BE TAKEN FOR A LETTER GRADE.

        "<p>Admission to the UC Berkeley <strong>College of Engineering</strong> is highly competitive.</p><p><br></p><p>Applicants to the <strong>Energy Engineering</strong> major must complete all required core UCB preparation courses in order to be eligible for admission. Only applicants who have completed 100% of these required courses will be considered for admission. Required courses for admission to the major must be completed by the end of the spring semester prior to fall enrollment. <strong>A summer 2026 course is not considered to be \"work in progress\" for the fall 2026 selection process.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103=Chemistry A and B), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion (e.g., 2 of the 3 required courses) will result in zero credit toward the requirement(s), and the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The only exception to the series rule is Math 54. If Math 54 is split into two different courses, one covering linear algebra and one covering differential equations, we strongly encourage applicants to take both courses at the same community college; however, the College of Engineering will accept linear algebra from one school and differential equations from a different school.</p><p><br></p><p>Lower division UC Berkeley courses required for graduation (but not admission) are also listed in the major agreements and are strongly recommended to be taken to strengthen one's application. The more of these courses completed, the stronger the application will be.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Required core courses for admission: (all these courses must be completed to be considered for admission)</strong></p><p>- UCB CHEM 1A/1AL</p><p>- UCB MATH 51; 52; 53; 54</p><p>- UCB PHYSICS 7A; 7B</p><p>- UCB READING COMPOSITION A; B</p><p>- One course from: CHEM 1B; CHEM 3A/3AL or PHYSICS 7C</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Strongly recommended courses: (if your college offers the courses listed below and they are articulated, taking them will strengthen your application) </strong></p><p>- UCB COMPSCI 61A or ENGIN 7</p><p>- UCB MEC ENG 40 or ENGIN 40</p><p>- UCB MATH 55</p><p>- One from: COMPSCI 61B; EECS 16A; EECS 16B; MAT SCI 45/45L; CIV ENG 11 or CIV ENG 70; MEC ENG C85/CIV ENG C30</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Articulation subject to completion of a university course </strong></p><p>If the above statement is indicated under any of the community college course listed below, you will be required to take an additional course at UC Berkeley in order to complete the requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>Admission is primarily based on the completeness of the applicant's lower division preparation and the level of academic achievement reflected in the student's grade point average. The UC applicant essay also plays an important role in the selection process at UC Berkeley. The College reviews the essay for evidence of interest in the student's chosen field and a thoughtful match between the academic program and the student's academic and career objectives.</p><p><br></p><p>The College of Engineering requires six humanities/social science courses, two of which must be reading and composition. The only non-technical admission requirement for the College of Engineering is the coursework equivalent to UC Berkeley's Reading and Composition A and B, which must be taken for a letter grade. The College of Engineering <strong>does not recognize the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (Cal-GETC/IGETC) and strongly discourages</strong> students from following this option due to the number of major-specific technical courses required for engineering transfer admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Reading and Composition requirements cannot be satisfied by Cal-GETC/IGETC; applicants must complete the specific courses indicated as Reading and Composition A and B equivalents to be considered for admission. Failure to complete the exact courses listed will mean the applicant will NOT be considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p>The remaining four humanities/social science requirement courses are not considered for admission purposes but are required for graduation. See <a href=\"http://coe.berkeley.edu/hssreq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hss</a> for the College of Engineering humanities/social science breadth requirements and courses. Courses which are three semester units or more that appear in the following categories on the \"General Education/Breadth\" section of <a href=\"http://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assist.org</a> may be used to satisfy <strong>two of</strong> the remaining four humanities/social science course requirements for the College of Engineering. ARTS AND LITERATURE; HISTORICAL STUDIES; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES; PHILOSOPHY AND VALUES; SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. Additionally, courses that teach a foreign language may be used to satisfy this requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>SAT/ACT/A-level test scores and letters of recommendation are NOT considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE: ALL REQUIRED COURSES AND ALL STRONGLY RECOMMENDED COURSES FOR THE MAJOR MUST BE TAKEN FOR A LETTER GRADE.

        "<p>Admission to the UC Berkeley <strong>College of Engineering</strong> is highly competitive.</p><p><br></p><p>Applicants to the <strong>Engineering Mathematics and Statistics</strong> major must complete all required core UCB preparation courses in order to be eligible for admission. Only applicants who have completed 100% of these required courses will be considered for admission. Required courses for admission to the major must be completed by the end of the spring semester prior to fall enrollment. <strong>A summer 2026 course is not considered to be \"work in progress\" for the fall 2026 selection process.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103=Chemistry A and B), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion (e.g., 2 of the 3 required courses) will result in zero credit toward the requirement(s), and the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The only exception to the series rule is Math 54. If Math 54 is split into two different courses, one covering linear algebra and one covering differential equations, we strongly encourage applicants to take both courses at the same community college; however, the College of Engineering will accept linear algebra from one school and differential equations from a different school.</p><p><br></p><p>Lower division UC Berkeley courses required for graduation (but not admission) are also listed in the major agreements and are strongly recommended to be taken to strengthen one's application. The more of these courses completed, the stronger the application will be.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Required core courses for admission: (all these courses must be completed to be considered for admission)</strong></p><p>- UCB CHEM 1A/1AL</p><p>- UCB MATH 51; 52; 53; 54</p><p>- UCB PHYSICS 7A; 7B; 7C</p><p>- UCB READING COMPOSITION A; B</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Strongly recommended courses: (if your college offers the courses listed below and they are articulated, taking them will strengthen your application)</strong></p><p>- Two courses from: UCB CIV ENG C30/MEC ENG C85; COMPSCI 61C; ENGIN 29; MAT SCI 45/45L; MATH 55 or COMPSCI 70 or COMPSCI C8</p><p>- Two courses in Computer Science: UCB COMPSCI 61A or ENGIN 7 and COMPSCI 61B</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Articulation subject to completion of a university course </strong></p><p>If the above statement is indicated under any of the community college course listed below, you will be required to take an additional course at UC Berkeley in order to complete the requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>Admission is primarily based on the completeness of the applicant's lower division preparation and the level of academic achievement reflected in the student's grade point average. The UC applicant essay also plays an important role in the selection process at UC Berkeley. The College reviews the essay for evidence of interest in the student's chosen field and a thoughtful match between the academic program and the student's academic and career objectives.</p><p><br></p><p>The College of Engineering requires six humanities/social science courses, two of which must be reading and composition. The only non-technical admission requirement for the College of Engineering is the coursework equivalent to UC Berkeley's Reading and Composition A and B, which must be taken for a letter grade. The College of Engineering<strong> does not recognize the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (Cal-GETC/IGETC) and strongly discourages students</strong> from following this option due to the number of major-specific technical courses required for engineering transfer admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The Reading and Composition requirements cannot be satisfied by Cal-GETC/IGETC; applicants must complete the specific courses indicated as Reading and Composition A and B equivalents to be considered for admission. Failure to complete the exact courses listed will mean the applicant will NOT be considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p>The remaining four humanities/social science requirement courses are not considered for admission purposes but are required for graduation. See <a href=\"http://coe.berkeley.edu/hssreq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hss</a> for the College of Engineering humanities/social science breadth requirements and courses. Courses which are three semester units or more that appear in the following categories on the \"General Education/Breadth\" section of <a href=\"http://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assist.org</a> may be used to satisfy <strong>two of</strong> the remaining four humanities/social science course requirements for the College of Engineering. ARTS AND LITERATURE; HISTORICAL STUDIES; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES, PHILOSOPHY AND VALUES; SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. Additionally, courses that teach a foreign language may be used to satisfy this requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>SAT/ACT/A-level test scores and letters of recommendation are NOT considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE: ALL REQUIRED COURSES AND ALL STRONGLY RECOMMENDED COURSES FOR THE MAJOR MUST BE TAKEN FOR A LETTER GRADE.

        "<p>Admission to the UC Berkeley <strong>College of Engineering</strong> is highly competitive.</p><p><br></p><p>Applicants to the <strong>Engineering Physics</strong> major must complete all required core UCB preparation courses in order to be eligible for admission. Only applicants who have completed 100% of these required courses will be considered for admission. Required courses for admission to the major must be completed by the end of the spring semester prior to fall enrollment. <strong>A summer 2026 course is not considered to be \"work in progress\" for the fall 2026 selection process.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103=Chemistry A and B), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion (e.g., 2 of the 3 required courses) will result in zero credit toward the requirement(s), and the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The only exception to the series rule is Math 54. If Math 54 is split into two different courses, one covering linear algebra and one covering differential equations, we strongly encourage applicants to take both courses at the same community college; however, the College of Engineering will accept linear algebra from one school and differential equations from a different school.</p><p><br></p><p>Lower division UC Berkeley courses required for graduation (but not admission) in the major agreements and are strongly recommended to be taken to strengthen one’s application. The more of these courses completed, the stronger the application will be.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Required core courses for admission: (all these courses must be completed to be considered for admission)</strong></p><p>- UCB CHEM 1A/1AL</p><p>- UCB MATH 51; 52; 53; 54</p><p>- UCB PHYSICS 7A; 7B; 7C</p><p>- UCB READING COMPOSITION A; B</p><p><br></p><p><strong>THREE courses from the following list:</strong></p><p>- UCB ASTRON 7A; 7B</p><p>- UCB BIOLOGY 1A/1AL; 1B</p><p>- UCB CHEM 1B; 3A/3AL</p><p>- UCB COMPSCI 70 (COMPSCI 70 is offered during the Berkeley Summer session or Concurrent Enrollment)</p><p>- UCB EECS 16A; 16B</p><p>- UCB MAT SCI 45/45L</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Strongly recommended courses: (if your college offers the courses listed below and they are articulated, taking them will strengthen your application) </strong>For courses with no articulation, students are strongly encouraged to take a Computer Programming course.</p><p><br></p><p>-UCB COMPSCI 61A or COMPSCI 61B or ENGIN 7</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Articulation subject to completion of a university course</strong></p><p>If the above statement is indicated under any of the community college course listed below, you will be required to take an additional course at UC Berkeley in order to complete the requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>Admission is primarily based on the completeness of the applicant's lower division preparation and the level of academic achievement reflected in the student's grade point average. The UC applicant essay also plays an important role in the selection process at UC Berkeley. The College reviews the essay for evidence of interest in the student's chosen field and a thoughtful match between the academic program and the student's academic and career objectives.</p><p><br></p><p>The College of Engineering requires six humanities/social science courses, two of which must be reading and composition. The only non-technical admission requirement for the College of Engineering is the coursework equivalent to UC Berkeley's Reading and Composition A and B, which must be taken for a letter grade. The College of Engineering <strong>does not recognize the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (Cal-GETC/IGETC) and strongly discourages students </strong>from following this option due to the number of major-specific technical courses required for engineering transfer admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Reading and Composition requirements cannot be satisfied by Cal-GETC/IGETC; applicants must complete the specific courses indicated as as Reading and Composition A and B equivalents to be considered for admission. Failure to complete the exact courses listed will mean the applicant will NOT be considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p>The remaining four humanities/social science requirement courses are not considered for admission purposes but are required for graduation. See <a href=\"http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hssreq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hss</a> for the College of Engineering humanities/social science breadth requirements and courses. Courses which are three semester units or more that appear in the following categories on the \"General Education/Breadth\" section of <a href=\"http://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assist.org</a> may be used to satisfy <strong>two of</strong> the remaining four humanities/social science course requirements for the College of Engineering. ARTS AND LITERATURE; HISTORICAL STUDIES; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES, PHILOSOPHY AND VALUES; SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. Additionally, courses that teach a foreign language may be used to satisfy this requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>SAT/ACT/A-level test scores and letters of recommendation are NOT considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE: ALL REQUIRED COURSES AND ALL STRONGLY RECOMMENDED COURSES FOR THE MAJOR MUST BE TAKEN FOR A LETTER GRADE.

        "<p><strong>Please Note: </strong>Applicants are expected to complete all required coursework by the end of the spring term prior to admission. Majors may allow one course pending in the summer term prior to admission if the major has more than five required courses and at least five courses of the required coursework have been completed; in this case, if a requirement includes both a lecture and lab, the lecture and lab together are treated as one course. Majors which require five or fewer required courses to transfer will not allow required coursework to be completed in the summer prior to admission.

Partial completion of the series (e.g., two of the three required courses) may result in no credit toward the requirement(s), and splitting a series of courses between different community colleges is not guaranteed to satisfy the requirement. Courses taken out of series will be evaluated by college faculty during the transfer admissions process.

        "<p>Admission to the UC Berkeley <strong>College of Engineering</strong> is highly competitive.</p><p><br></p><p>Applicants to the <strong>Environmental Engineering Science</strong> major must complete all required core UCB preparation courses in order to be eligible for admission. Only applicants who have completed 100% of these required courses will be considered for admission. Required courses for admission to the major must be completed by the end of the spring semester prior to fall enrollment.<strong> A summer 2026 course is not considered to be \"work in progress\" for the fall 2026 selection process.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103=Chemistry A and B), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion (e.g., 2 of the 3 required courses) will result in zero credit toward the requirement(s), and the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The only exception to the series rule is Math 54. If Math 54 is split into two different courses, one covering linear algebra and one covering differential equations, we strongly encourage applicants to take both courses at the same community college; however, the College of Engineering will accept linear algebra from one school and differential equations from a different school.</p><p><br></p><p>Lower division UC Berkeley courses required for graduation (but not admission) are also listed in the major agreements and are strongly recommended to be taken to strengthen one's application. The more of these courses completed, the stronger the application will be.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Required core courses for admission: (all these courses must be completed to be considered for admission) </strong></p><p>- UCB CHEM 1A/1AL</p><p>- UCB MATH 51; 52; 53; 54</p><p>- UCB PHYSICS 7A; 7B</p><p>- UCB READING COMPOSITION A; B</p><p>- Three courses: from UCB BIOLOGY 1A/AL; BIOLOGY 1B; CHEM 1B; CHEM 3A/3AL; CHEM 3B/3BL; EPS 50; PHYSICS 7C</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Strongly recommended courses: (if your college offers the courses listed below and they are articulated, taking them will strengthen your application)</strong> If no articulation, students are strongly encouraged to take a course in Statics AND a course in Computer Programming.</p><p>- UCB CIV ENG C30/MEC ENG C85</p><p>- UCB ENGIN 7</p><p>- UCB MEC ENG 40 or ENGIN 40</p><p>- UCB CIV ENG 11</p><p><br></p><p>Admission is primarily based on the completeness of the applicant's lower division preparation and the level of academic achievement reflected in the student's grade point average. The UC applicant essay also plays an important role in the selection process at UC Berkeley. The College reviews the essay for evidence of interest in the student's chosen field and a thoughtful match between the academic program and the student's academic and career objectives.</p><p><br></p><p>The College of Engineering requires six humanities/social science courses, two of which must be reading and composition. The only non-technical admission requirement for the College of Engineering is the coursework equivalent to UC Berkeley's Reading and Composition A and B, which must be taken for a letter grade. The College of Engineering <strong>does not recognize the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (Cal-GETC/IGETC) and strongly discourages </strong>from following this option due to the number of major-specific technical courses required for engineering transfer admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Reading and Composition requirements <u>cannot </u>be satisfied by Cal-GETC/IGETC; applicants must complete the specific courses indicated as Reading and Composition A and B equivalents to be considered for admission. Failure to complete the exact courses listed will mean the applicant will NOT be considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p>The remaining four humanities/social science requirement courses are not considered for admission purposes but are required for graduation. See <a href=\"http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hssreq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hss</a> for the College of Engineering humanities/social science breadth requirements and courses. Courses which are three semester units or more that appear in the following categories on the \"General Education/Breadth\" section of <a href=\"http://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assist.org</a> may be used to satisfy<strong> two of</strong> the remaining four humanities/social science course requirements for the College of Engineering. ARTS AND LITERATURE; HISTORICAL STUDIES; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES; PHILOSOPHY AND VALUES; SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. Additionally, courses that teach a foreign language may be used to satisfy this requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>SAT/ACT/A-level test scores and letters of recommendation are NOT considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE: ALL REQUIRED COURSES AND ALL STRONGLY RECOMMENDED COURSES FOR THE MAJOR MUST BE TAKEN FOR A LETTER GRADE.

        "<p>Admission to the UC Berkeley <strong>College of Engineering</strong> is highly competitive.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a new major at UC Berkeley starting Fall 2025. Applicants to the <strong>Environmental Engineering</strong> major must complete all required core UCB preparation courses in order to be eligible for admission. Only applicants who have completed 100% of these required courses will be considered for admission. Required courses 6for admission to the major must be completed by the end of the spring semester prior to fall enrollment. <strong>A summer 2026 course is not considered to be \"work in progress\" for the fall 2026 selection process.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103 = Chemistry A and B), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion (e.g., 2 of the 3 required courses) will result in zero credit toward the requirement(s), and the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The only exception to the series rule is Math 54. If Math 54 is split into two different courses, one covering linear algebra and one covering differential equations, we strongly encourage applicants to take both courses at the same community college; however, the College of Engineering will accept linear algebra from one school and differential equations from a different school.</p><p><br></p><p>Lower division UC Berkeley courses required for graduation (but not admission) are also listed in the major agreements and are strongly recommended to be taken to strengthen one's application. The more of these courses completed, the stronger the application will be</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Required core courses for admission: (all these courses must be completed to be considered for admission)</strong></p><p>- UCB BIOLOGY 1B</p><p>- UCB CHEM 1A+1AL</p><p>- UCB CHEM 1B; or CHEM 3A+CHEM 3AL; or PHYSICS 7B; or MEC ENG 40</p><p>- UCB PHYSICS 7A</p><p>- UCB MATH 51; 52; 53; 54</p><p>- UCB READING AND COMPOSITION A; B</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Strongly recommended courses: (if your college offers the courses below and they are articulated, taking them will strengthen your application) If no articulation exists, students are strongly encouraged to take a course in Statics AND a course in Computer Programming.</strong></p><p>- UCB CIV ENG 11; CIV ENG 30; CIV ENG 70; CIV ENG 93</p><p>- UCB ENGIN 7</p><p>- UCB COMPSCI C8</p><p><br></p><p>Admission is primarily based on the completeness of the applicant's lower division preparation and the level of academic achievement reflected in the student's grade point average. The UC applicant essay also plays an important role in the selection process at UC Berkeley. The College reviews the essay for evidence of interest in the student's chosen field and a thoughtful match between the academic program and the student's academic and career objectives.</p><p><br></p><p>The College of Engineering requires six humanities/social science courses, two of which must be reading and composition. The only non-technical admission requirement for the College of Engineering is the coursework equivalent to UC Berkeley's Reading and Composition A and B, which must be taken for a letter grade. The College of Engineering <strong>does not recognize the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (Cal-GETC/IGETC) and strongly discourages</strong> students from following this option due to the number of major-specific technical courses required for engineering transfer admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Reading and Composition requirements <u>cannot </u>be satisfied by Cal-GETC/IGETC; applicants must complete the specific courses indicated as Reading and Composition A and B equivalents to be considered for admission. Failure to complete the exact courses listed will mean the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The remaining four humanities/social science requirement courses are not considered for admission purposes but are required for graduation. See <a href=\"http://coe.berkeley.edu/hssreq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hss</a> for the College of Engineering humanities/social science breadth requirements and courses. Courses which are three semester units or more that appear in the following categories on the \"General Education/Breadth\" section of <a href=\"http://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assist.org</a> may be used to satisfy <strong>two of </strong>the remaining four humanities/social science course requirements for the College of Engineering. ARTS AND LITERATURE; HISTORICAL STUDIES; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES; PHILOSOPHY AND VALUES; SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. Additionally, courses that teach a foreign language may be used to satisfy this requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>SAT/ACT/A-level test scores and letters of recommendation are NOT considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE: ALL REQUIRED COURSES AND ALL STRONGLY RECOMMENDED COURSES FOR THE MAJOR MUST BE TAKEN FOR A LETTER GRADE.

        "<p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES MAJOR</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The major emphasizes basic science in a rigorous curriculum drawn from a variety of departments including biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, economics and environmental science. In the junior and senior years, students take electives in their area of interest, as well as courses in statistics, research methodology, and environmental modeling to prepare for the senior research thesis seminar. In the research seminar, each student designs and conducts a research project of his or her own choosing. This year-long course is the capstone of the major. The experience is extremely helpful for students as they prepare for environmental careers or graduate/professional school.</p><p><br></p><p>For additional information, please contact the Environmental Sciences advisor at <a href=\"mailto:envsci.ugrad@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">envsci.ugrad@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Please Note: </strong>Applicants are expected to complete all required coursework by the end of the spring term prior to admission. Majors may allow one course pending in the summer term prior to admission if the major has more than five required courses and at least five courses of the required coursework have been completed; in this case, if a requirement includes both a lecture and lab, the lecture and lab together are treated as one course. Majors which require five or fewer required courses to transfer will not allow required coursework to be completed in the summer prior to admission. Please see the <a href=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/transfer-applicants\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rausser College of Natural Resources Transfer Applicants page</a> for individual requirements by major.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Environmental Sciences applicants may have the opportunity to complete a single required course in the summer term prior to admission. If a requirement includes both a lecture and lab, the lecture and lab together are treated as one course.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>To ensure full articulation of transfer coursework: </strong>if a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103 = CHEM 1A/1AL + CHEM 1B at UC Berkeley), all of the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion of the series (e.g., two of the three required courses) may result in no credit toward the requirement(s), and splitting a series of courses between different community colleges is not guaranteed to satisfy the requirement. Courses taken out of series will be evaluated by college faculty during the transfer admissions process. If you have questions about the articulation of a series for your intended major, please email <a href=\"mailto:envsci.ugrad@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">envsci.ugrad@berkeley.edu</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Minimum Admissions Requirements in Environmental Sciences:</strong></p><p><strong><em>Please note that the required chemistry sequence and biology coursework for Environmental Sciences may vary based on the concentration you are pursuing in the major.

        "<p>The group major in Film &amp; Media has been designed to place the history and theory of film into the larger context of humanistic studies. Emphasis is placed on developing students' analytical and critical faculties. Courses are offered in the history of film, the history of film theory, genres, and auteurs. Also offered are numerous elective courses related to the general study of film. A recent update of the Film &amp; Media curriculum has also substantially expanded Production course offerings, both writing-based and practical production.</p><p><br></p><p>Berkeley offers an innovative, interdisciplinary undergraduate program leading to a BA in Film &amp; Media. This rich and diverse program offers rigorous engagement with the entire culture of moving-images in the larger context of humanistic studies, teaching students to think historically, theoretically, and analytically about a wide range of cinematic and para-cinematic forms. At the same time, it encourages students to look at moving-images from the vantage point of other disciplines. The major has expanded recently as well, giving more consideration to practical production, writing-based courses, and expanding the curriculum to cover more New Media topics.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>For more information:</strong></p><p>Undergraduate Advisor</p><p><a href=\"mailto:filmmediaugadvising@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">filmmediaugadvising@berkeley.edu</a></p><p>(510) 642-3522</p><p><a href=\"https://filmmedia.berkeley.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://filmmedia.berkeley.edu/</a></p>"

        "<p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>ABOUT THE GENETICS &amp; PLANT BIOLOGY MAJOR</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Genetics and Plant Biology (GPB) combines traditional plant sciences (physiology, biochemistry, morphology) with more recent biological disciplines (molecular genetics and genomics) to study the role of plants in the global environment. The discipline emphasizes the study of plants from the sub-molecular levels to the organismal level. Relevant applications include biotechnology, bioenergy, agriculture, biomedical, food science, bioinformatics, and genetic counseling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>For additional information, please contact the Genetics &amp; Plant Biology advisor at <a href=\"mailto:pmb.ugrad@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pmb.ugrad@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Please Note: </strong>Applicants are expected to complete all required coursework by the end of the spring term prior to admission. Majors may allow one course pending in the summer term prior to admission if the major has more than five required courses and at least five courses of the required coursework have been completed; in this case, if a requirement includes both a lecture and lab, the lecture and lab together are treated as one course. Majors which require five or fewer required courses to transfer will not allow required coursework to be completed in the summer prior to admission. Please see the <a href=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/transfer-applicants\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rausser College of Natural Resources Transfer Applicants page</a> for individual requirements by major.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Genetics &amp; Plant Biology applicants may have the opportunity to complete a single required course in the summer term prior to admission. If a requirement includes both a lecture and lab, the lecture and lab together are treated as one course.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>To ensure full articulation of transfer coursework: </strong>if a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103 = CHEM 1A/1AL + CHEM 1B at UC Berkeley), all of the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion of the series (e.g., two of the three required courses) may result in no credit toward the requirement(s), and splitting a series of courses between different community colleges is not guaranteed to satisfy the requirement. Courses taken out of series will be evaluated by college faculty during the transfer admissions process. If you have questions about the articulation of a series for your intended major, please email <a href=\"mailto:pmb.ugrad@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pmb.ugrad@berkeley.edu</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Minimum Admissions Requirements in Genetics &amp; Plant Biology:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Equivalent of:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>READING &amp; COMPOSITION A + READING &amp; COMPOSTION B - satisfied by full UC IGETC, or may be satisfied with <a href=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/AP%2C%20IB%2C%20and%20A-level%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chart.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AP/IB/A-Level exam credit</a></li><li>CHEM 1A and CHEM 1AL - may also be satisfied by <a href=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/AP%2C%20IB%2C%20and%20A-level%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chart.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AP/IB/A-Level exam credit</a></li><li>CHEM 3A and CHEM 3AL</li><li>CHEM 3B and CHEM 3BL</li><li>BIOLOGY 1A and BIOLOGY 1AL</li><li>BIOLOGY 1B</li><li>MATH 16A and MATH 16B; or MATH 51 and MATH 52; or MATH 10A and MATH 10B - may also be satisfied by <a href=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/AP%2C%20IB%2C%20and%20A-level%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chart.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AP/IB/A-Level exam credit</a></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Highly Recommended (but not required) Prior to Transfer</strong></p><ul><li>STAT 2, STAT 20, or DATA C8 - may also be satisfied by <a href=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/AP%2C%20IB%2C%20and%20A-level%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chart.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AP/IB/A-Level exam credit</a></li><li>PHYSICS 8A - students pursuing a pre-health curriculum may also be required to complete the second half of physics (PHYSICS 8B at Berkeley) which is not required by the Microbial Biology major</li><li>15 units of breadth coursework in the social sciences and humanities - satisfied by full UC IGETC, or may be satisfied with <a href=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/AP%2C%20IB%2C%20and%20A-level%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chart.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AP/IB/A-Level exam credit</a></li></ul>"

        "<p>Global Studies majors must demonstrate proficiency in a modern language other than English by the last semester of their senior year. This language must be connected, in either the past or the present, to the student’s geographic region of specialization. Proficiency is equivalent to the ability achieved in four college-level semesters (or two years). Language courses taken in high school do not satisfy this requirement. See below for details on how to fulfill the foreign language requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>Note: languages accepted by the College of Letters &amp; Science are not automatically accepted by the Global Studies major. Please check with an adviser for eligible languages.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How to fulfill the foreign language requirement:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>There are a variety of ways to fulfill the four-semester language requirement for Global Studies, depending on the individual and his or her background and ability.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) test:</strong> An AP score of 5 or an International Baccalaureate (IB) score of 7 will complete this requirement. An AP score of 4 should generally place a student into the fourth-semester college level course. A score of 3 will place a student into the third-semester college level course. Documentation of AP scores must be provided.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Coursework:</strong> Any combination of college courses, summer programs, or college-level study abroad programs can satisfy the language requirement. At a minimum, students must complete the fourth semester (i.e., the second semester of intermediate level) of a language with a grade of C- or better in order to fulfill the requirement. The first, second, and third semester courses may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis.</p><p><br></p><p>Language courses need not be taken at UCB. Courses taken at a community college or any accredited school or university may be acceptable. Transcripts must be submitted and evaluated by an adviser. A one-semester upper division course taken abroad in the target language may satisfy the foreign language requirement, depending on the school and program followed.&nbsp;For more information, see an adviser concerning language study abroad.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>High school completion in a non-English language and Proficiency Tests:</strong> Students with native, advanced background or those who were educated in a non-English language through the completion of high school or the equivalent may wish to satisfy this requirement with that experience. This requires a language proficiency exam. Moreover, it limits the geographic focus within global studies, because it must be connected to language. This is not especially recommended, as it limits what students within the major can study.</p><p><br></p><p>Chinese, Japanese, and Korean proficiency exams are administered by East Asian Languages and Cultures (EALC) on the Tuesday before instruction starts every semester. Check the EALC website at <a href=\"http://ealc.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/proficiency-exams\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://ealc.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/proficiency-exams</a>. Results of the exam will indicate the level of the foreign language that students are eligible to register for. In order to waive the language requirement, test results must show that the student has completed the equivalent of four semesters of language studies (end of intermediate level) or higher.</p><p><br></p><p>Note: EALC waitlists all students that register for language courses regardless of when registration takes place, and the department scheduler adjusts student enrollment based on the results of the placement exam during the first week of instruction.</p><p><br></p><p>Students planning to take a proficiency exam in a non-Asian language in order to waive the language requirement should consult with an IAS adviser. Proficiency tests may be taken once per semester.</p>",

        "<p>Admission to the UC Berkeley <strong>College of Engineering</strong> is highly competitive.</p><p><br></p><p>Applicants to the<strong> Industrial Engineering and Operations Research</strong> major must complete all required core UCB preparation courses in order to be eligible for admission. Only applicants who have completed 100% of these required courses will be considered for admission. Required courses for admission to the major must be completed by the end of the spring semester prior to fall enrollment. <strong>A summer 2026 course is not considered to be \"work in progress\" for the fall 2026 selection process.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103=Chemistry A and B), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion (e.g., 2 of the 3 required courses) will result in zero credit toward the requirement(s), and the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The only exception to the series rule is Math 54. If Math 54 is split into two different courses, one covering linear algebra and one covering differential equations, we strongly encourage applicants to take both courses at the same community college; however, the College of Engineering will accept linear algebra from one school and differential equations from a different school.</p><p><br></p><p>Lower division UC Berkeley courses required for graduation (but not admission) are also listed in the major agreements and are strongly recommended to be taken to strengthen one's application. The more of these courses completed, the stronger the application will be.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Required core courses for admission: (all these courses must be completed to be considered for admission)</strong></p><p>- UCB CHEM 1A/1AL or BIOLOGY 1A/1AL or BIOLOGY 1B</p><p>- UCB MATH 51; 52; 53; 54</p><p>- UCB PHYSICS 7A; 7B</p><p>- UCB READING COMPOSITION A; B</p><p>- UCB COMPSCI 61A, COMPSCI C8, or other programming courses</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Strongly recommended courses: (if your college offers the courses listed below and they are articulated, taking them will strengthen your application)</strong> If no articulation exists, students are strongly encouraged to take an introductory course in electronics or circuits AND a course in Computer Programming</p><p><br></p><p>- UCB ENGIN 7</p><p>- Nine units from UCB CIV ENG 11; CIV ENG C30 or MEC ENG C85; CIV ENG 60; CIV ENG 70; EECS 16A; EECS 16B; ENGIN 26; ENGIN 29; MAT SCI 45/45L; MEC ENG 40</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Articulation subject to completion of a university course </strong></p><p>If the above statement is indicated under any of the community college course listed below, you will be required to take an additional course at UC Berkeley in order to complete the requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>Admission is primarily based on the completeness of the applicant's lower division preparation and the level of academic achievement reflected in the student's grade point average. The UC applicant essay also plays an important role in the selection process at UC Berkeley. The College reviews the essay for evidence of interest in the student's chosen field and a thoughtful match between the academic program and the student's academic and career objectives.</p><p><br></p><p>The College of Engineering requires six humanities/social science courses, two of which must be reading and composition. The only non-technical admission requirement for the College of Engineering is the coursework equivalent to UC Berkeley's Reading and Composition A and B, which must be taken for a letter grade. The College of Engineering <strong>does not recognize the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (Cal-GETC/IGETC) and strongly discourages students</strong> from following this option due to the number of major-specific technical courses required for engineering transfer admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Reading and Composition requirements <u>cannot </u>be satisfied by Cal-GETC/IGETC; applicants must complete the specific courses indicated as Reading and Composition A and B equivalents to be considered for admission. Failure to complete the exact courses listed will mean the applicant will NOT be considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p>The remaining four humanities/social science requirement courses are not considered for admission purposes but are required for graduation. See <a href=\"http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hssreq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hss</a> for the College of Engineering humanities/social science breadth requirements and courses. Courses which are three semester units or more that appear in the following categories on the \"General Education/Breadth\" section of <a href=\"http://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assist.org</a> may be used to satisfy two of the remaining four humanities/social science course requirements for the College of Engineering. ARTS AND LITERATURE; HISTORICALSTUDIES; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES; PHILOSOPHY AND VALUES; SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. Additionally, courses that teach a foreign language may be used to satisfy this requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>SAT/ACT/A-level test scores and letters of recommendation are NOT considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE: ALL REQUIRED COURSES AND ALL STRONGLY RECOMMENDED COURSES FOR THE MAJOR MUST BE TAKEN FOR A LETTER GRADE.

        "<p>This major is offered by the College of Environmental Design (CED).</p><p><br></p><p>The undergraduate curriculum in <strong>Landscape Architecture</strong> centers upon creative and ecologically tuned design and introduces students to the breadth of knowledge common to the profession. At the heart of the undergraduate curriculum are three upper division studio courses that students take at UC Berkeley. The core studios ensure that undergraduate students benefit from the department's full range of interests and expertise.</p><p><br></p><p>The undergraduate studio experience rests upon a foundation of professional courses in four key areas:</p><p><br></p><p>(1) design skills and methods, including the lower division design courses, landscape architecture history, and computer methods;</p><p>(2) ecological analysis, with courses in ecology and geography;</p><p>(3) planting design (two courses supplemented with an integrative biology requirement); and</p><p>(4) topographic design.</p><p><br></p><p>The undergraduate program leads to the B.A. degree in Landscape Architecture and provides the necessary education for students interested in either entry-level professional practice, graduate work in Landscape Architecture or further studies in a related environmental design field. The B.A. degree is certified by the State of California and counts as part of the education/experience requirement of the U.N.E. licensing exam.

        "<p>Admission to the UC Berkeley <strong>College of Engineering</strong> is highly competitive.</p><p><br></p><p>Applicants to the <strong>Materials Science and Engineering</strong> major must complete all required core UCB preparation courses in order to be eligible for admission. Only applicants who have completed 100% of these required courses will be considered for admission. Required courses for admission to the major must be completed by the end of the spring semester prior to fall enrollment.<strong> A summer 2026 course is not considered to be \"work in progress\" for the fall 2026 selection process.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103=Chemistry A and B), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion (e.g., 2 of the 3 required courses) will result in zero credit toward the requirement(s), and the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The only exception to the series rule is Math 54. If Math 54 is split into two different courses, one covering linear algebra and one covering differential equations, we strongly encourage applicants to take both courses at the same community college; however, the College of Engineering will accept linear algebra from one school and differential equations from a different school. Lower division UC Berkeley courses required for graduation (but not admission) are also listed in the major agreements and are strongly recommended to be taken to strengthen one's application. The more of these courses completed, the stronger the application will be.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Required core courses for admission: (all these courses must be completed to be considered for admission)</strong></p><p>- UCB CHEM 1A/1AL; 1B</p><p>- UCB MATH 51; 52; 53; 54</p><p>- UCB PHYSICS 7A; 7B; 7C</p><p>- UCB READING COMPOSITION A; B</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Strongly recommended courses: (if your college offers the courses listed below and they are articulated, taking them will strengthen your application) </strong>If no articulation, students are strongly encouraged to take a course in statics AND a course in Computer Programming.</p><p>- UCB ENGIN 7</p><p>- UCB MAT SCI 45/45L</p><p>- UCB MEC ENG C85/CIV ENG C30</p><p>- UCB ENGIN 40</p><p>- UCB COMPSCI C8</p><p><br></p><p>Admission is primarily based on the completeness of the applicant's lower division preparation and the level of academic achievement reflected in the student's grade point average. The UC applicant essay also plays an important role in the selection process at UC Berkeley. The College reviews the essay for evidence of interest in the student's chosen field and a thoughtful match between the academic program and the student's academic and career objectives.</p><p><br></p><p>The College of Engineering requires six humanities/social science courses, two of which must be reading and composition. The only non-technical admission requirement for the College of Engineering is the coursework equivalent to UC Berkeley's Reading and Composition A and B, which must be taken for a letter grade. The College of Engineering <strong>does not recognize the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (Cal-GETC/IGETC) and strongly discourages students </strong>from following this option due to the number of major-specific technical courses required for engineering transfer admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Reading and Composition requirements <u>cannot </u>be satisfied by Cal-GETC/IGETC; applicants must complete the specific courses indicated as Reading and Composition A and B equivalents to be considered for admission. Failure to complete the exact courses listed will mean the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The remaining four humanities/social science requirement courses are not considered for admission purposes but are required for graduation. See <a href=\"http://coe.berkeley.edu/hssreq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hss</a> for the College of Engineering humanities/social science breadth requirements and courses. Courses which are three semester units or more that appear in the following categories on the \"General Education/Breadth\" section of <a href=\"http://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assist.org</a> may be used to satisfy two of the remaining four humanities/social science course requirements for the College of Engineering. ARTS AND LITERATURE; HISTORICAL STUDIES; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES PHILOSOPHY AND VALUES; SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. Additionally, courses that teach a foreign language may be used to satisfy this requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>SAT/ACT/A-level test scores and letters of recommendation are NOT considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE: ALL REQUIRED COURSES AND ALL STRONGLY RECOMMENDED COURSES FOR THE MAJOR MUST BE TAKEN FOR A LETTER GRADE.

        "<p>Admission to the UC Berkeley <strong>College of Engineering</strong> is highly competitive.</p><p><br></p><p>Applicants to the <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong> major must complete all required core UCB preparation courses in order to be eligible for admission. Only applicants who have completed 100% of these required courses will be considered for admission. Required courses for admission to the major must be completed by the end of the spring semester prior to fall enrollment.<strong> A summer 2026 course is not considered to be \"work in progress\" for the fall 2026 selection process.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103=Chemistry A and B), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion (e.g., 2 of the 3 required courses) will result in zero credit toward the requirement(s), and the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The only exception to the series rule is Math 54. If Math 54 is split into two different courses, one covering linear algebra and one covering differential equations, we strongly encourage applicants to take both courses at the same community college; however, the College of Engineering will accept linear algebra from one school and differential equations from a different school. Lower division UC Berkeley courses required for graduation (but not admission) are also listed in the major agreements and are strongly recommended to be taken to strengthen one's application. The more of these courses completed, the stronger the application will be.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Required core courses for admission: (all these courses must be completed to be considered for admission)</strong></p><p>- UCB CHEM 1A</p><p>- UCB MATH 51; 52; 53; 54</p><p>- UCB PHYSICS 7A; 7B</p><p>- One from UCB: ASTRON 7A; 7B; BIOLOGY 1A/1AL; 1B; COMPSCI C8; CHEM 1B; 3A/3AL; 3B/3BL; PHYSICS 7C; MCELLBI 32; STAT 20</p><p>- UCB READING COMPOSITION A; B</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Strongly recommended courses: (if your college offers the courses listed below and they are articulated, taking them will strengthen your application)</strong> If no articulation, students are strongly encouraged to take a course in SolidWorks and a course in Computer Programming</p><p>- UCB ENGIN 7</p><p>- UCB ENGIN 26</p><p>- UCB ENGIN 29</p><p>- UCB MEC ENG 40</p><p>- UCB MEC ENG C85/CIV ENG C30</p><p><br></p><p>Admission is primarily based on the completeness of the applicant's lower division preparation and the level of academic achievement reflected in the student's grade point average. The UC applicant essay also plays an important role in the selection process at UC Berkeley. The College reviews the essay for evidence of interest in the student's chosen field and a thoughtful match between the academic program and the student's academic and career objectives.</p><p><br></p><p>The College of Engineering requires six humanities/social science courses, two of which must be reading and composition. The only non-technical admission requirement for the College of Engineering is the coursework equivalent to UC Berkeley's Reading and Composition A and B, which must be taken for a letter grade. The College of Engineering <strong>does not recognize the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (Cal-GETC/IGETC) and strongly discourages </strong>students from following this option due to the number of major-specific technical courses required for engineering transfer admission. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Reading and Composition requirements <u>cannot </u>be satisfied by Cal-GETC/IGETC; applicants must complete the specific courses indicated as Reading and Composition A and B equivalents to be considered for admission. Failure to complete the exact courses listed will mean the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The remaining four humanities/social science requirement courses are not considered for admission purposes but are required for graduation. See <a href=\"http://coe.berkeley.edu/hssreq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hss</a> for the College of Engineering humanities/social science breadth requirements and courses. Courses which are three semester units or more that appear in the following categories on the \"General Education/Breadth\" section of <a href=\"http://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assist.org</a> may be used to satisfy two of the remaining four humanities/social science course requirements for the College of Engineering. ARTS AND LITERATURE; HISTORICAL STUDIES; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES; PHILOSOPHY AND VALUES; SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. Additionally, courses that teach a foreign language may be used to satisfy this requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>SAT/ACT/A-level test scores and letters of recommendation are NOT considered for admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE: ALL REQUIRED COURSES AND ALL STRONGLY RECOMMENDED COURSES FOR THE MAJOR MUST BE TAKEN FOR A LETTER GRADE.

        "<p>The <strong>Media Studies</strong> major integrates perspectives from liberal arts, social sciences, and humanities and offers an interdisciplinary framework to understand the essential role that media plays in economic, social, political, and cultural life. It weds traditions from communication, history, anthropology, sociology, political science, and more with critical theories and cultural studies to analyze the role and meaning of media in our societies. Our emphasis in this major is historical and theoretical, examining media systems, institutions, technologies, policies, and practices. We offer students the analytical tools available to investigate media—old and new, local and global—across the diverse media landscape. The Media Studies major offers three areas of concentration: Digital Studies, Global Cultural Studies, or Media Law and Policy.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Declaring the Media Studies Major</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Admission to UC Berkeley with the stated intent to major in Media Studies does not guarantee acceptance into the major. A major declaration is required after arrival at Berkeley. To be eligible to declare the major, students&nbsp;must 1) complete all four prerequisites; 2) have a C or better in each of the four prerequisites; and 3) have a GPA of 2.0 in the prerequisites and any course that applies to the major course requirements. All courses for the major, including prerequisites, must be taken for a letter grade.</p><p><br></p><p>Media Studies 10 must be completed at UC Berkeley. Any Media Studies 10 transfer course equivalents completed after summer 2020 will not satisfy the Media Studies 10 requirement. Media Studies 10 is often offered in the summer at UC Berkeley. Summer courses are open to students from other schools. Transfer students are not expected to take Media Studies 10 before applying to UC Berkeley.</p><p><br></p><p>Exam (i.e. AP/IB) credit cannot be used to satisfy any major requirements.

        "<p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>ABOUT THE MICROBIAL BIOLOGY MAJOR</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Microbial Biology (MB) is a pivotal field of study because small life forms such as microbes, viruses, and fungi make up the majority of planetary biomass, and constitute key branches of the Tree of Life. Microbes play fundamental roles in maintaining biosphere health: they degrade environmental pollutants; they supply essential nutrients and chemicals directly to multi-cellular organisms, and they engage in numerous beneficial symbioses with higher organisms. Infectious diseases regulate populations of plants and animals, and outbreaks recur in human societies globally.</p><p><br></p><p>For additional information, please contact the Microbial Biology advisor at <a href=\"mailto:pmb.ugrad@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pmb.ugrad@berkeley.edu</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
        "<p><strong>Please Note: </strong>Applicants are expected to complete all required coursework by the end of the spring term prior to admission. Majors may allow one course pending in the summer term prior to admission if the major has more than five required courses and at least five courses of the required coursework have been completed; in this case, if a requirement includes both a lecture and lab, the lecture and lab together are treated as one course. Majors which require five or fewer required courses to transfer will not allow required coursework to be completed in the summer prior to admission. Please see the <a href=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/transfer-applicants\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rausser College of Natural Resources Transfer Applicants page</a> for individual requirements by major.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Microbial Biology applicants may have the opportunity to complete a single required course in the summer term prior to admission. If a requirement includes both a lecture and lab, the lecture and lab together are treated as one course.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>To ensure full articulation of transfer coursework: </strong>if a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103 = CHEM 1A/1AL + CHEM 1B at UC Berkeley), all of the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion of the series (e.g., two of the three required courses) may result in no credit toward the requirement(s), and splitting a series of courses between different community colleges is not guaranteed to satisfy the requirement. Courses taken out of series will be evaluated by college faculty during the transfer admissions process.

        "<p><strong>Please Note: </strong>Applicants are expected to complete all required coursework by the end of the spring term prior to admission. Majors may allow one course pending in the summer term prior to admission if the major has more than five required courses and at least five courses of the required coursework have been completed; in this case, if a requirement includes both a lecture and lab, the lecture and lab together are treated as one course. Majors which require five or fewer required courses to transfer will not allow required coursework to be completed in the summer prior to admission.

Partial completion of the series (e.g., two of the three required courses) may result in no credit toward the requirement(s), and splitting a series of courses between different community colleges is not guaranteed to satisfy the requirement. Courses taken out of series will be evaluated by college faculty during the transfer admissions process.

        "<p>Admission to the UC Berkeley <strong>College of Engineering</strong> is highly competitive.</p><p><br></p><p>Applicants to the <strong>Nuclear Engineering</strong> major must complete all required core UCB preparation courses in order to be eligible for admission. Only applicants who have completed 100% of these required courses will be considered for admission. Required courses for admission to the major must be completed by the end of the spring semester prior to fall enrollment. <strong>A summer 2026 course is not considered to be \"work in progress\" for the fall 2026 selection process.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., Chemistry 101 + 102 + 103=Chemistry A and B), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must (unless otherwise indicated) be completed at the same community college. Partial completion (e.g., 2 of the 3 required courses) will result in zero credit toward the requirement(s), and the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The only exception to the series rule is Math 54. If Math 54 is split into two different courses, one covering linear algebra and one covering differential equations, we strongly encourage applicants to take both courses at the same community college; however, the College of Engineering will accept linear algebra from one school and differential equations from a different school.</p><p><br></p><p>Lower division UC Berkeley courses required for graduation (but not admission) are also listed in the major agreements and are strongly recommended to be taken to strengthen one's application. The more of these courses completed, the stronger the application will be.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Required core courses for admission: (all these courses must be completed to be considered for admission) </strong></p><p>- UCB CHEM 1A/1AL</p><p>- UCB MATH 51; 52; 53; 54</p><p>- UCB PHYSICS 7A; 7B; 7C</p><p>- UCB READING COMPOSITION A; B</p><p><br></p><p>Select one from the following:</p><p>- UCB ASTRON 7A</p><p>- UCB BIOLOGY 1A/1AL; 1B</p><p>- UCB CHEM 1B; 3A/3AL</p><p>- UCB MCELLBI 32/32L</p><p>- UCB STAT 20</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Strongly recommended courses: (if your college offers the courses listed below and they are articulated, taking them will strengthen your application) </strong></p><p>- UCB ENGIN 40</p><p>- UCB EECS 16A</p><p>- UCB ENGIN 7</p><p>- UCB MAT SCI 45/45L</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Articulation subject to completion of a university course</strong></p><p>If the above statement is indicated under any of the community college course listed below, you will be required to take an additional course at UC Berkeley in order to complete the requirement. Admission is primarily based on the completeness of the applicant's lower division preparation and the level of academic achievement reflected in the student's grade point average. The UC applicant essay also plays an important role in the selection process at UC Berkeley. The College reviews the essay for evidence of interest in the student's chosen field and a thoughtful match between the academic program and the student's academic and career objectives.</p><p><br></p><p>The College of Engineering requires six humanities/social science courses, two of which must be reading and composition. The only non-technical admission requirement for the College of Engineering is the coursework equivalent to UC Berkeley's Reading and Composition A and B, which must be taken for a letter grade. The College of Engineering <strong>does not recognize the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (Cal-GETC/IGETC) and strongly discourages students </strong>from following this option due to the number of major-specific technical courses required for engineering transfer admission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The Reading and Composition requirements <u>cannot </u>be satisfied by Cal-GETC/IGETC; applicants must complete the specific courses indicated as Reading and Composition A and B equivalents to be considered for admission. Failure to complete the exact courses listed will mean the applicant will NOT be considered for admission. The remaining four humanities/social science requirement courses are not considered for admission purposes but are required for graduation. See <a href=\"http://coe.berkeley.edu/hssreq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hss</a> for the College of Engineering humanities/social science breadth requirements and courses. Courses which are three semester units or more that appear in the following categories on the \"General Education/Breadth\" section of <a href=\"http://assist.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assist.org</a> may be used to satisfy two of the remaining four humanities/social science course requirements for the College of Engineering.

Students are educated in the experimental biology of metabolic regulation, the impact of genetics on use of dietary constituents, and the interaction among genetics, health/chronic disease and dietary chemicals. This program prepares students to perform research into the relationship between diet and vertebrate development and well-being mechanistically, and/or for health professional careers.</p><p><br></p><p>For additional information, please contact the Nutritional Sciences advisor at <a href=\"mailto:nst.ugrad@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">nst.ugrad@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Please Note: </strong>Applicants are expected to complete all required coursework by the end of the spring term prior to admission. Majors may allow one course pending in the summer term prior to admission if the major has more than five required courses and at least five courses of the required coursework have been completed; in this case, if a requirement includes both a lecture and lab, the lecture and lab together are treated as one course. Majors which require five or fewer required courses to transfer will not allow required coursework to be completed in the summer prior to admission.

Partial completion of the series (e.g., two of the three required courses) may result in no credit toward the requirement(s), and splitting a series of courses between different community colleges is not guaranteed to satisfy the requirement. Courses taken out of series will be evaluated by college faculty during the transfer admissions process.

We believe a Physics degree represents strong training for a broad range of careers. Approximately half of our recent graduates have continued to graduate school in Physics and related fields; others have taken jobs in high tech industries or as management consultants, and still others have entered medical school or law school. We aim to help our majors develop strong mathematical and analytical skills, good laboratory skills, effective written and oral communication skills, and of course a solid understanding of the fundamental laws that govern the universe.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Learn more about UC Berkeley physics on our website: </strong></p><p><a href=\"https://physics.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-degree/the-major-and-minor-program\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://physics.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-degree/the-major-and-minor-program</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>For more information:</strong></p><p>Location: UC Berkeley Department of Physics, Physics Building, Berkeley, CA 94720-7300</p><p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:physics-student-services@lists.berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">physics-student-services@lists.berkeley.edu</a></p>",

        "<p><strong>Political Economy (PE)</strong> examines the relationship between politics and economics in modern societies and focuses on problems of both domestic and international policy. Based on the assumption that political-economic relationships are affected by any number of factors, such as society, culture, geography, and demographics, the curriculum is both multi- and interdisciplinary in scope. The focus of the major is on contemporary issues, although a strong historical perspective is also emphasized. Students may also study planning and problem solving, environmental issues, resource distribution, and the challenges of institutional adaptation, and changing political systems.</p><p><br></p><p>The major is designed to provide a broad-based liberal arts background, as well as the intellectual skills appropriate for careers in either the public or private sector. Additionally, the major offers an excellent background for students planning postgraduate careers in social science disciplines and professional schools.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of the questions addressed in the major include: </p><p>-the tension between rising consumer demand and the need to minimize resource depletion and pollution;</p><p>-the different priorities served by capitalist, socialist, and traditionalist varieties of political economy;</p><p>-the different priorities served by democratic and authoritarian political systems; </p><p>-how international interdependence may undermine the efforts of national governments to cope with unemployment, inflation, trade and payment deficits, health, housing and welfare problems, and other societal issues. </p><p>-the importance of organizational structures for policy-making in both the public and private sector.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>For more information: </strong></p><p><a href=\"https://politicaleconomy.berkeley.edu/courses-of-study/the-political-economy-major/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://politicaleconomy.berkeley.edu/courses-of-study/the-political-economy-major/</a></p>"

        "<p>Public health seeks to improve human health through the development and application of knowledge that prevents disease, protects the public from harm, and promotes health throughout the state, the nation, and the world. Students in the <strong>Public Health, Bachelor of Arts</strong> <strong>major </strong>will develop and apply knowledge from multiple disciplines for the promotion and protection of the health of the human population. Some areas of study that students have focused on are: Biostatistics, Community Health &amp; Human Development, Environmental Health Sciences, Epidemiology, Health Policy &amp; Management, Infectious Diseases, Nutrition, and Maternal, Child, and Adolescent Health.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Admission to UC Berkeley with the stated intent to major in Public Health does not guarantee acceptance into the major.</strong> A departmental application is required and prerequisites must be met.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Public Health Major Declaration Requirements for Transfer Students:</strong></p><p><br></p><ol><li>Transfer students must apply by the end of their first term in attendance at UC Berkeley. Students may only apply to the major once, no exceptions. The application will require unofficial transcripts, essays, a prerequisite GPA calculation form, and a resume. Admissions requirements and application instructions: <a href=\"https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Undergraduate Admissions</a></li><li>Transfer students must complete all of the lower division prerequisites (mathematics, biology, and social sciences). A minimum grade of \"C-\" is required for any of the prerequisites.</li><li>It is crucial that all students applying to the public health major have a BACK UP MAJOR since admission into the Public Health major is not guaranteed.</li><li>In your first year, it is strongly encouraged to enroll in Data C8: Foundations of Data Science. This course is a major requirement, not a prerequisite for the major, however, it will help prepare you for other major course requirements. This is a very technical course, so please plan accordingly.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Most transfer students complete the majority of their lower-division prerequisite courses prior to UC Berkeley. However, transfer students may fulfill the remaining requirements during their first semester at UC Berkeley. If you have completed all your prerequisites the Spring before you start your first semester at UC Berkeley, you may be eligible to apply in the May application cycle.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>For more information about applying to the major during your first semester at UC Berkeley, read more about the Undergraduate Admissions at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Public Health Undergraduate Program</a>&nbsp;or contact an undergraduate advisor at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:sphug@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sphug@berkeley.edu</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Did you know that we also offer a Global Public Health Summer Minor? There is no application for the summer minor but there is a declaration and completion form. The GPH Summer Minor consists of 5 courses that can be taken within one or two consecutive summers.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE REQUIREMENT&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Seven units from the following Biology classes: BIOLOGY 1A (3); BIOLOGY 1B (4); MCELLBI 32 (3); MCELLBI 38 (3); MCELLBI 50 (4); MCELLBI 55 (3); NEU C61 (3); NUSCTX 10 (3). A minimum grade of \"C-\" is required. You cannot split any class series.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lab units do not count towards the seven unit requirement.</strong> For example, BIOLOGY 1AL is not required for the major but is usually required with the BIOLOGY 1A lecture. The lab will not be counted for prerequisite units for the public health major.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You must complete all courses in a series at the same school.</strong> Unless the course equivalents are separately specified, do not assume that a sequence can be divided. If a series of courses at a community college is required (e.g., BIOL 101 and 102 and 103 = BIOLOGY 1A &amp; 1AL), all the courses in the series must be completed, and must be completed at the same community college.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>MATHEMATICS REQUIREMENT*&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A part 1 and part 2 from the following. A minimum grade of \"C-\" is required. Students could potentially mix and match courses but course restrictions may apply.</p><ul><li>Part 1: Math 51 or Math 1A, Math 10A, Math 16A</li><li>Part 2: Math 52 or Math 1B, Math 10B, Math 16B</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>SOCIAL SCIENCES REQUIREMENT*&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Three courses from at least two of the following areas: SOCIOLOGY, ECONOMICS, ANTHROPOLOGY, POLITICAL SCIENCE and PSYCHOLOGY. You cannot split any class series.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><u>Please note that credit may </u><strong><u>NOT </u></strong><u>be earned with both SOCIOL 1 + SOCIOL 3AC; or PSYCH 1 + PSYCH 2; or ECON 1 + ECON 2 + ECON C3</u>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LOWER DIVISION REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><p>DATA/COMPSCI/INFO/STAT/C8 - Foundations of Data Science&nbsp;</p><p>This is a major requirement, not a prerequisite however it is best to take this course earlier.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>*Advanced Placement (AP) Exam and International Baccalaureate (IB) Exam scores can be used to fulfill Math and Social Sciences requirements.

        "<p><strong>PREPARATION FOR TRANSFER AT THE JUNIOR LEVEL</strong></p><p><br></p><p>As East European and Eurasian languages are not offered at California community colleges, the elementary first-year language sequences are started during the student's first Fall semester at Berkeley for the following: Armenian 1A-1B (Introductory Armenian), Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian 27A-B (Introductory BCS),&nbsp;Czech 26A-B (Introductory Czech), Hungarian 1A-B (Introductory Hungarian), Polish 25A-B (Introductory Polish), and Ukrainian 1A-B (Introductory Ukrainian). The required 4-semester language sequence is therefore completed in the two years following admission.</p><p>In 2024-25, Hungarian, Polish, and Ukrainian language courses in the Slavic Department are available for Intersegmental Cross-enrollment, for students enrolled at any California Community College. Courses are taught via synchronous online instruction. Student eligibility, enrollment requisites, and instructor approval may apply.</p><p><br></p><p>For more information:<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://registrar.berkeley.edu/registration/visitor-and-exchange-programs/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://registrar.berkeley.edu/registration/visitor-and-exchange-programs/</a></p><p>Contact:<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"mailto:special_programs@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">special_programs@berkeley.edu</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Once admitted, students who have a prior background in their proposed target language (Armenian, BCS, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, or Ukrainian) may be required to take a language proficiency test or to consult with the relevant department language program coordinator for placement in the correct language course level. Students who participated in UC Berkeley Slavic Department language courses prior to admission to UC Berkeley may not have to take a proficiency test.</p><p><br></p><p>Lower-division Russian language courses (equivalent of Russian 1, 2, 3 and 4) must be completed prior to transfer for the Russian Language and Literature track; for the Russian Culture emphasis (the track in Russian/East European/Eurasian Cultures), the equivalent of Russian 1 and 2 is preferred, but otherwise Russian 1, 2, 3, and 4 can be taken upon transfer. Once admitted, students who have a prior background in Russian may be required to take a language proficiency test or to consult with the relevant department language program coordinator for placement in the correct language course level.</p><p><br></p><p>See the Slavic Department's language placement webpage for more information:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slavic.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/take-class/language-placement\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://slavic.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/take-class/language-placement</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>For more information:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Undergraduate Student Services Advisor, Slavic Languages and Literatures</p><p><br></p><p>(510) 642 4661</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"mailto:issaug@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">issaug@berkeley.edu</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"http://slavic.berkeley.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://slavic.berkeley.edu/</a></p>",
        "<p><strong>MAJOR TRACK IN RUSSIAN/EAST EUROPEAN/EURASIAN CULTURES</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The major track in Russian/East European/Eurasian Cultures integrates the study of languages and cultures of a large area: Russia, Eastern/Central Europe and Eurasia. While all majors will be exposed to the knowledge of the whole area, this track allows each student to focus either on one specific cultural region or to combine different regions in their studies (e.g. Russian culture, the cultures of Russia and Caucasus; Balkan cultures; Central European cultures).</p><p><br></p><p>Each student's program of study must be designed in consultation with and approved by the Major Adviser and will include a language emphasis in one language area as designated below. As East European and Eurasian languages are not offered at California community colleges, the elementary first-year language sequences are started during the student's first fall semester at Berkeley: Armenian 1A-B, BCS 27A-B, Polish 25A-B, Czech 26A-B, Hungarian 1A-1B, or Ukrainian 1A-B. For students emphasizing Russian language for this track, if your community college offers Russian 1 and 2 (Elementary Russian), plan to take it in preparation for transfer; if it is unavailable, you will still be able to complete Russian 1, 2, 3, and 4 once admitted. In summary, the required 4-semester language sequences can be completed in the two years following admission.</p><p><br></p><p>Once admitted, students who have a prior background in their proposed target language (Armenian, BCS, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Russian, or Ukrainian) will be required to take a language proficiency test or to consult with the relevant department language program coordinator for placement in the correct language course level and credit toward relevant lower-division language courses will be applied to the specific set of major requirements.</p><p>Introduction to Russian, East European and Eurasian Cultures (SLAVIC 50), which is a prerequisite for this major and is not offered at community colleges, is taken upon admission to Berkeley.</p>"

        "<p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>ABOUT THE SOCIETY &amp; ENVIRONMENT MAJOR</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Social and environmental problems are deeply intertwined. This major introduces students to the main approaches and theory for environmental social sciences, including how social science tools can be applied to environmental problems, and how social science theories contribute to understanding environmental problems.&nbsp; At the upper division level there are three major areas of concentration. Students are exposed to all three areas and choose to focus in one:&nbsp; U.S. Environmental Policy and Management, Global Environmental Politics, or Justice &amp; Sustainability.</p><p><br></p><p>For additional information, please contact the Society &amp; Environment advisor at <a href=\"mailto:soc.env.ugrad@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">soc.env.ugrad@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Please Note: </strong>Applicants are expected to complete all required coursework by the end of the spring term prior to admission. Majors may allow one course pending in the summer term prior to admission if the major has more than five required courses and at least five courses of the required coursework have been completed; in this case, if a requirement includes both a lecture and lab, the lecture and lab together are treated as one course. Majors which require five or fewer required courses to transfer will not allow required coursework to be completed in the summer prior to admission.

Partial completion of the series (e.g., two of the three required courses) may result in no credit toward the requirement(s), and splitting a series of courses between different community colleges is not guaranteed to satisfy the requirement. Courses taken out of series will be evaluated by college faculty during the transfer admissions process. If you have questions about the articulation of a series for your intended major, please email <a href=\"mailto:soc.env.ugrad@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">soc.env.ugrad@berkeley.edu</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Minimum Admissions Requirements in Society &amp; Environment:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Equivalent of:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>READING &amp; COMPOSITION A + READING &amp; COMPOSTION B - satisfied by full UC IGETC, or may be satisfied with <a href=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/AP%2C%20IB%2C%20and%20A-level%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chart.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AP/IB/A-Level exam credit</a></li><li>ECON 1, ECON 2, ECON C3, <strong>or a transferable course in micro-economics</strong> (only one required) - may also be satisfied by <a href=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/AP%2C%20IB%2C%20and%20A-level%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chart.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AP/IB/A-Level exam credit</a></li><li>MATH 16A or MATH 51 or STAT 2 - may also be satisfied by <a href=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/AP%2C%20IB%2C%20and%20A-level%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chart.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AP/IB/A-Level exam credit</a></li><li>Transferable Biological Science breadth course - satisfied by full UC IGETC</li><li>Transferable Physical Science breadth course - satisfied by full UC IGETC</li><li>Transferable International Studies breadth course - satisfied by full UC IGETC</li><li>Transferable Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences breadth course - satisfied by full UC IGETC</li><li>Transferable Arts &amp; Literature or Historical Studies or Philosophy &amp; Values breadth course (only one required) - satisfied by full UC IGETC</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Highly Recommended (but not required) Prior to Transfer</strong></p><ul><li>ESPM Social Science and ESPM Environmental Science core courses if offered at your institution</li></ul>"

As the world population grows and urbanizes, the planning and design of systems that produce outcomes that are resilient, resource-efficient, healthy and socially just is profoundly important. The College of Environmental Design, with its long-standing, multidisciplinary focus on innovation and social equity is an ideal setting for an undergraduate major in SED, with a strong focus on systems.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The major offers students a critical understanding of the sustainability challenges facing regions in California and around the globe, and equips them with the technical and analytical tools key to solving sustainability problems that affect people, products and places. Graduates have many career paths and fields of graduate study open to them as a function of the diversity of topics and tools they will encounter and engage in SED. Students who complete this major will:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Understand the features and functions of systems that drive sustainability challenges.</li><li>Analyze the relationships between technological systems, systems of governance, and production systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Identify interactions between sustainability, equity and social justice.</li><li>Use quantitative analysis to understand the potential of sensors and information dashboards to produce innovation in design and management approaches.&nbsp;</li><li>Leverage the potential of strategy, policy, business and institutions to adapt to and influence environmental, social and economic trends.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Studio Instruction in CED</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Sustainable Environmental Design major is not a studio-based major.

        "<p>Within the <strong>Theater and Performance Studie</strong>s curriculum, we engage with performance on physical, intellectual, and aesthetic levels. It is our hope that students will not only grow as performers, but also as artists, thinkers, makers, and viewers of the whole artistic event.</p><p><br></p><p>The practical focus of the major is to create theater of all kinds using all its art forms. Whether new to theater or seasoned with years of training and skill, all students receive an education that engages them fully. Your focus may be on acting, technical theater or design, performance studies, or some combination of these. Equally important to us is the study of theater and dance performance theory, history, culture, and literature, thereby balancing the practical with the theoretical. Students engage in other upper division electives in stage management, playwriting, directing, choreography, sound design, scenic design, costume design, or lighting design, as well as a myriad of performance opportunities.</p><p><br></p><p>The theater training and academic courses offered by our department are geared toward the student who is interested in learning about theater and performance from multiple perspectives. As either a major or minor in Theater and Performance Studies, you will study with nationally and internationally known faculty, respected for their scholarly research and for their creative work. Our graduates have gone on to professional careers in all theatrical fields and graduate schools all over the world. Our alumni include professional actors on stage and screen, arts journalists, stunt actors, directors, producers, playwrights, and more.</p><p><br></p><p>Further departmental opportunities include student-directed theater performances and projects, honors projects, internships in local Bay Area theaters, teaching courses in the department, and invitations to diverse and exciting lectures and performances. Students also have access to world-renowned visiting guest artists through our close relationship with Cal Performances and our extensive network in the field.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>For more information:</strong></p><p>Laxmi Kumaran</p><p>Undergraduate Academic Advisor</p><p>Department of Theater, Dance and Performance Studies</p><p>15-B Dwinelle Hall (Level C)</p><p><a href=\"mailto:laxmik@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">laxmik@berkeley.edu</a></p><p><a href=\"http://tdps.berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tdps.berkeley.edu</a></p>",
