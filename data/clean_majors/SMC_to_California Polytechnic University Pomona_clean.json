        "<p><strong>Campus Impaction</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"Campus Impaction\" means that a campus has reached its enrollment capacity for instructional resources and physical support and cannot accommodate all the eligible undergraduate applications it receives. Cal Poly Pomona has established a <a href=\"https://www.cpp.edu/admissions/transfer/local-area.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">local admission area</a> for upper-division transfers.

As a campus, Cal Poly Pomona provides a varying transfer GPA bump, based on major, to ensure a local area admission preference. In addition, as a part of our commitment to provide access to veterans, Cal Poly Pomona gives \"Local Preference\" to all veterans regardless of transferring institution.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Supplemental Required and Recommended Courses</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Cal Poly Pomona has implemented a multifactor admission (MFA) model to evaluate all incoming transfer applicants.

Cal Poly Pomona has established a <a href=\"https://www.cpp.edu/admissions/transfer/local-area.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">local admission area</a> for upper-division transfers. In general, applicants from outside the designated local area will be held to a higher admission standard than those received from applicants inside the local area.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Local Area Admission Preference</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Transfer applications applying to an impacted major will receive \"Local Preference\" for admission consideration if the majority of their units are coming from one of our <a href=\"https://www.cpp.edu/admissions/transfer/local-area.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">local area</a> schools. As a campus, Cal Poly Pomona provides a varying transfer GPA bump, based on major, to ensure a local area admission preference. In addition, as a part of our commitment to provide access to veterans, Cal Poly Pomona gives \"Local Preference\" to all veterans regardless of transferring institution.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Supplemental Required and Recommended Courses</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Cal Poly Pomona has implemented a multifactor admission (MFA) model to evaluate all incoming transfer applicants. Many of our majors have required <strong>or</strong> recommended supplemental courses that will help prepare prospective applicants for further studies in their major.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong><em>Required</em></strong> supplemental courses must be completed with a grade of \"C\" or higher to be considered for admission</li><li><strong><em>Recommended</em></strong> supplemental coursework will earn additional consideration based on how many of the recommended courses are completed with a \"C\" or higher</li><li>Local area applicants must complete any <u>required</u> coursework to be admissible and will receive a local preference bump</li><li>Local area applicants will receive additional points for any <u>recommended</u> coursework and will receive a local preference bump</li></ul><p><br></p><p><em>Please note, supplemental coursework is waived for Chemistry, Biology, and Sociology (starting 2022-2023) by completion of an </em><a href=\"https://www.cpp.edu/admissions/transfer/associate-degree-for-transfer.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>associate degree for transfer (ADT)</em></a><em> in a similar major.

        "<p><strong>Campus Impaction</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"Campus Impaction\" means that a campus has reached its enrollment capacity for instructional resources and physical support and cannot accommodate all the eligible undergraduate applications it receives.

        "<p>The Bachelors of Architecture (B.Arch.), is a five year professional degree program. Transfer students seeking second year placement, must have completed <u>all</u> lower-division general education and architecture courses required of first year CPP/ARC students. To be placed the in third year, a transfer student must have completed <u>all</u> lower-division general education and architecture courses required of CPP/ARC students in both the first and second years. Based upon a portfolio review and transcripts, most transfer students are placed in first year, some are placed in second year, and very few are eligible to be placed into the third year of the program.

Not all students that have a GPA of 3.2 or higher will be admitted as the number of students admitted each year is based on the number of spaces available. The admissions office selects students based on highest GPA and works down the list (from highest to lowest GPA) until all seats have been filled.</p><p><br></p><p>Transfer students who are offered admissions to the program, or are placed on a wait list for admission, will be invited to submit an 8 1/2” by 11” bound portfolio of their work so that the department can determine in which year of study each student should be placed. The department offers a portfolio workshop for accepted transfer students in early spring semester in advance of placement. The workshop provides advice and coaching to produce an effective portfolio, however the workshop does not guarantee advanced placement or a remedy for deficient work. THE PORTFOLIO IS NOT USED TO DETERMINE ADMISSIONS, IT IS ONLY USED TO DETERMINE PLACEMENT (1ST, 2ND OR 3RD YEAR). If no portfolio is submitted, students will be automatically placed in the first year design studio.</p>",

        "<p><strong>Campus Impaction</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"Campus Impaction\" means that a campus has reached its enrollment capacity for instructional resources and physical support and cannot accommodate all the eligible undergraduate applications it receives. Cal Poly Pomona has established a <a href=\"https://www.cpp.edu/admissions/transfer/local-area.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">local admission area</a> for upper-division transfers. In general, applicants from outside the designated local area will be held to a higher admission standard than those received from applicants inside the local area.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Local Area Admission Preference</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Transfer applications applying to an impacted major will receive \"Local Preference\" for admission consideration if the majority of their units are coming from one of our <a href=\"https://www.cpp.edu/admissions/transfer/local-area.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">local area</a> schools. As a campus, Cal Poly Pomona provides a varying transfer GPA bump, based on major, to ensure a local area admission preference. In addition, as a part of our commitment to provide access to veterans, Cal Poly Pomona gives \"Local Preference\" to all veterans regardless of transferring institution.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Supplemental Required and Recommended Courses</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Cal Poly Pomona has implemented a multifactor admission (MFA) model to evaluate all incoming transfer applicants. Many of our majors have required <strong>or</strong> recommended supplemental courses that will help prepare prospective applicants for further studies in their major.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong><em>Required</em></strong> supplemental courses must be completed with a grade of \"C\" or higher to be considered for admission</li><li><strong><em>Recommended</em></strong> supplemental coursework will earn additional consideration based on how many of the recommended courses are completed with a \"C\" or higher</li><li>Local area applicants must complete any <u>required</u> coursework to be admissible and will receive a local preference bump</li><li>Local area applicants will receive additional points for any <u>recommended</u> coursework and will receive a local preference bump</li></ul><p><br></p><p><em>Please note, supplemental coursework is waived for Chemistry, Biology, and Sociology (starting 2022-2023) by completion of an </em><a href=\"https://www.cpp.edu/admissions/transfer/associate-degree-for-transfer.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>associate degree for transfer (ADT)</em></a><em> in a similar major.

        "<p><strong>Campus Impaction</strong></p><p><br></p><p>\"Campus Impaction\" means that a campus has reached its enrollment capacity for instructional resources and physical support and cannot accommodate all the eligible undergraduate applications it receives. Cal Poly Pomona has established a <a href=\"https://www.cpp.edu/admissions/transfer/local-area.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">local admission area</a> for upper-division transfers. In general, applicants from outside the designated local area will be held to a higher admission standard than those received from applicants inside the local area.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Local Area Admission Preference</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Transfer applications applying to an impacted major will receive \"Local Preference\" for admission consideration if the majority of their units are coming from one of our <a href=\"https://www.cpp.edu/admissions/transfer/local-area.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">local area</a> schools.

        "The California Commission on Teacher Credential (CTC) requires that students have a 2.67 overall GPA or a 2.75 in their last 60 semester units of course work to enter the credential portion of the ITEP option. Students should work closely with faculty and advisors to ensure they meet the GPA requirements to enter the credential program.  Once in the credential program, students must maintain a 3.0 GPA in all credential coursework to move onto Clinical Practice.",
        "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(43, 134, 24);\">What is the ITEP Program?</strong> </p><p><br></p><p>The Integrated Teacher Education Program (ITEP) is a combined 4-year bachelor’s degree and credential program for students desiring a Special Education (i.e., Education Specialist) credential. It allows students to receive their bachelor’s degree in Liberal Studies, as well as their preliminary special education credential with an authorization in either mild/moderate disabilities or moderate/severe disabilities. ITEP is a full-time program, but because it is more cost effective and time efficient, students can get into their own classrooms a whole year earlier than traditional programs. In response to the looming teacher shortages in special education, the goal of ITEP is to help fill that gap and to provide a more direct route for students wanting a career that truly makes a difference and changes lives. </p><p><br></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(43, 134, 24);\">Why Get an Education Specialist Credential? </strong></p><p><br></p><p>Teaching children with different abilities is not ordinary, routine, or like any other career. It is a profession in which you can make a difference and significantly impact the lives of children, youth and their families. Through effective teaching methods, collaboration, and caring support, you will empower students who thrive when understood and appreciated for their unique talents and contributions. As a special education teacher, you will be an advocate, a leader and an instructional expert as you partner with general education teachers, parents and other members of an interdisciplinary team to propel students to reach their full potential.</p><p><br></p><p>More ITEP information here: <a href=\"https://www.cpp.edu/~ceis/itep/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cpp.edu/~ceis/itep/</a></p>"

        "The California Commission on Teacher Credential (CTC) requires that students have a 2.67 overall GPA or a 2.75 in their last 60 semester units of course work to enter the credential portion of the ITEP option.

        "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(43, 134, 24);\">What is the ITEP Program?</strong> </p><p><br></p><p>The Integrated Teacher Education Program (ITEP) is a combined 4-year bachelor’s degree and credential program for students desiring a Special Education (i.e., Education Specialist) credential. It allows students to receive their bachelor’s degree in Liberal Studies, as well as their preliminary special education credential with an authorization in either mild/moderate disabilities or moderate/severe disabilities. ITEP is a full-time program, but because it is more cost effective and time efficient, students can get into their own classrooms a whole year earlier than traditional programs. In response to the looming teacher shortages in special education, the goal of ITEP is to help fill that gap and to provide a more direct route for students wanting a career that truly makes a difference and changes lives. </p><p><br></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(43, 134, 24);\">Why Get an Education Specialist Credential? </strong></p><p><br></p><p>Teaching children with different abilities is not ordinary, routine, or like any other career. It is a profession in which you can make a difference and significantly impact the lives of children, youth and their families. Through effective teaching methods, collaboration, and caring support, you will empower students who thrive when understood and appreciated for their unique talents and contributions. As a special education teacher, you will be an advocate, a leader and an instructional expert as you partner with general education teachers, parents and other members of an interdisciplinary team to propel students to reach their full potential.</p><p><br></p><p>More ITEP information here: <a href=\"https://www.cpp.edu/~ceis/itep/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cpp.edu/~ceis/itep/</a></p>"

        "<p>The requirements for passing the CSET to enter a multiple subject matter program have changed since July 2021 with Assembly Bill (AB) 130. \"AB 130 expands the available options to allow candidates to meet the Subject Matter Requirement through any one of the following methods:</p><p><br></p><p>1. Successful completion of coursework, as verified by a Commission-approved program of professional preparation that addresses each of the Commission-adopted domains of the applicable subject matter requirements.</p><p><br></p><p>2.

For Multiple Subject credentials, the major must be in liberal studies or an interdisciplinary major that includes coursework in the content areas identified in subdivision (b) of California Education Code section 44282”. (CCTC Coded Memo, July 22, 2021).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>As a result, completing a liberal studies degree replaces passing the CSET to enter a multiple subjects program. It is important to take the ADT as prescribed and the Pre-credential or ITEP in special education option curriculum to be fully prepared for the subject matter content for a multiple subjects credential program.</strong> In addition, AB 130 allows graduates to satisfy the CBEST with reading, math, and writing coursework from their bachelor’s degree.</p><p><br></p><p>It is highly recommended ADT students take transfer courses articulated with the CPP courses listed below as part of their ADT to ensure subject matter and graduation requirements are met within 60-semester units after transfer.</p><p><br></p><p>HST 1102 - World Civilizations from 1500 (3) (GE Area C2)</p><p>GSC 2120 + 2120L - Earth Science for Elementary Educators + Laboratory (3) (GE Areas B1 &amp; B3), or a course to satisfy a subject matter emphasis if already satisfied</p><p>MU 1000 - Introduction to Music (3) (GE Area C1), or a course to satisfy a subject matter emphasis if already satisfied</p>",
        "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(43, 134, 24);\">What is the ITEP Program?</strong> </p><p><br></p><p>The Integrated Teacher Education Program (ITEP) is a combined 4-year bachelor’s degree and credential program for students desiring a Special Education (i.e., Education Specialist) credential. It allows students to receive their bachelor’s degree in Liberal Studies, as well as their preliminary special education credential with an authorization in either mild/moderate disabilities or moderate/severe disabilities. ITEP is a full-time program, but because it is more cost effective and time efficient, students can get into their own classrooms a whole year earlier than traditional programs. In response to the looming teacher shortages in special education, the goal of ITEP is to help fill that gap and to provide a more direct route for students wanting a career that truly makes a difference and changes lives. </p><p><br></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(43, 134, 24);\">Why Get an Education Specialist Credential? </strong></p><p><br></p><p>Teaching children with different abilities is not ordinary, routine, or like any other career. It is a profession in which you can make a difference and significantly impact the lives of children, youth and their families. Through effective teaching methods, collaboration, and caring support, you will empower students who thrive when understood and appreciated for their unique talents and contributions. As a special education teacher, you will be an advocate, a leader and an instructional expert as you partner with general education teachers, parents and other members of an interdisciplinary team to propel students to reach their full potential.</p><p><br></p><p>More ITEP information here: <a href=\"https://www.cpp.edu/~ceis/itep/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cpp.edu/~ceis/itep/</a></p>",
        "The California Commission on Teacher Credential (CTC) requires that students have a 2.67 overall GPA or a 2.75 in their last 60 semester units of course work to enter the credential portion of the ITEP option. Students should work closely with faculty and advisors to ensure they meet the GPA requirements to enter the credential program.  Once in the credential program, students must maintain a 3.0 GPA in all credential coursework to move onto Clinical Practice."

        "<p>The requirements for passing the CSET to enter a multiple subject matter program have changed since July 2021 with Assembly Bill (AB) 130. \"AB 130 expands the available options to allow candidates to meet the Subject Matter Requirement through any one of the following methods:</p><p><br></p><p>1. Successful completion of coursework, as verified by a Commission-approved program of professional preparation that addresses each of the Commission-adopted domains of the applicable subject matter requirements.</p><p><br></p><p>2.

For Multiple Subject credentials, the major must be in liberal studies or an interdisciplinary major that includes coursework in the content areas identified in subdivision (b) of California Education Code section 44282”. (CCTC Coded Memo, July 22, 2021).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>As a result, completing a liberal studies degree replaces passing the CSET to enter a multiple subjects program. It is important to take the ADT as prescribed and the Pre-credential or ITEP in special education option curriculum to be fully prepared for the subject matter content for a multiple subjects credential program.</strong> In addition, AB 130 allows graduates to satisfy the CBEST with reading, math, and writing coursework from their bachelor’s degree.</p><p><br></p><p>It is highly recommended ADT students take transfer courses articulated with the CPP courses listed below as part of their ADT to ensure subject matter and graduation requirements are met within 60-semester units after transfer.</p><p><br></p><p>HST 1102 - World Civilizations from 1500 (3) (GE Area C2)</p><p>GSC 2120 + 2120L - Earth Science for Elementary Educators + Laboratory (3) (GE Areas B1 &amp; B3), or a course to satisfy a subject matter emphasis if already satisfied</p><p>MU 1000 - Introduction to Music (3) (GE Area C1), or a course to satisfy a subject matter emphasis if already satisfied</p>",
        "<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(43, 134, 24);\">What is the ITEP Program?</strong> </p><p><br></p><p>The Integrated Teacher Education Program (ITEP) is a combined 4-year bachelor’s degree and credential program for students desiring a Special Education (i.e., Education Specialist) credential. It allows students to receive their bachelor’s degree in Liberal Studies, as well as their preliminary special education credential with an authorization in either mild/moderate disabilities or moderate/severe disabilities. ITEP is a full-time program, but because it is more cost effective and time efficient, students can get into their own classrooms a whole year earlier than traditional programs. In response to the looming teacher shortages in special education, the goal of ITEP is to help fill that gap and to provide a more direct route for students wanting a career that truly makes a difference and changes lives. </p><p><br></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(43, 134, 24);\">Why Get an Education Specialist Credential? </strong></p><p><br></p><p>Teaching children with different abilities is not ordinary, routine, or like any other career. It is a profession in which you can make a difference and significantly impact the lives of children, youth and their families. Through effective teaching methods, collaboration, and caring support, you will empower students who thrive when understood and appreciated for their unique talents and contributions. As a special education teacher, you will be an advocate, a leader and an instructional expert as you partner with general education teachers, parents and other members of an interdisciplinary team to propel students to reach their full potential.</p><p><br></p><p>More ITEP information here: <a href=\"https://www.cpp.edu/~ceis/itep/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cpp.edu/~ceis/itep/</a></p>",
        "The California Commission on Teacher Credential (CTC) requires that students have a 2.67 overall GPA or a 2.75 in their last 60 semester units of course work to enter the credential portion of the ITEP option. Students should work closely with faculty and advisors to ensure they meet the GPA requirements to enter the credential program.  Once in the credential program, students must maintain a 3.0 GPA in all credential coursework to move onto Clinical Practice."
