        "<p>The Bachelor of Science in Agriculture is a multidisciplinary program that blends the contribution of a number of academic departments through upper division core courses and four concentrations: Agricultural Business, Agricultural Education, Horticulture and Sustainable Agriculture. The program encourages students to explore diverse approaches to agricultural production, distribution, and management in evolving economic and environmental settings. Experiential learning and applied research opportunities are offered through these concentrations. The major fosters sustainable relationships with area community colleges through the implementation of a “2+2” program design. Individuals who have an A.S. degree or equivalent in lower-division course work in Agriculture, Agricultural Science, Agricultural Economics, and closely related fields should consider obtaining their bachelor degree in the program. The program also offers a minor in Agriculture to students in other majors.</p><p><br></p><p>View information for the <a href=\"https://catalog.csustan.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=35&amp;poid=7795&amp;returnto=6777\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Economics, Agriculture, and Social Sciences</a>, including Learning Objectives for the department and its programs.</p>",

        "<p>The Art History B.A. program provides students with a multicultural and global awareness of art and culture, as well as the useful daily skill of visual literacy–not just of artwork, but also of advertising, architectural structures, and popular culture. Course offerings cover a wide range of subjects within global contexts, encouraging students to become responsible citizens through an understanding of the aesthetic, cultural, and ethical issues present in our complex contemporary world. The B.A. in Art History offers a platform for students to examine, to identify, and to appreciate the visual arts and cultural production from prehistory to the present in multiple regions and contexts.</p><p><br></p><p>Students gain exposure to a broad, global spectrum of interconnected approaches to the critical study of the history of art, architecture, visual culture, and museums. The faculty members are dedicated scholars who bring a diverse range of experience and expertise to the classroom. Students benefit from close interaction and mentoring. Art History majors not only engage rigorous art historical scholarship and theoretical texts, producing their own creative research in the process, but also participate in courses and practicums that can help prepare them for gallery and museum careers, as well as many other disciplines, such as law school. The skills earned from studying Art History include critical thinking, aesthetics, interpersonal skills, non-verbal communication, analytical depth, visual literacy, and memory and pattern recognition, as well as a better understanding of human cultures and the creative expressions of humanity’s experiences, from prehistory to the contemporary. Students must meet the general admission requirements of the university.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>View information for the <a href=\"https://catalog.csustan.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=35&amp;poid=7802&amp;returnto=6777\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Art</a>, including Learning Objectives for the department and its programs.</p>"

This interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary program draws from fields including Philosophy, Computer Science, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, Art, Biology, and Physics. Cognitive Studies emphasizes strategies for investigating how real (biological) and artificial (computational) brains individually and cooperatively solve problems, form concepts, process language, interpret visual and other sensory input, and develop understandings of the world. Students in the program will examine traditional approaches to understanding the mind, with a strong emphasis on philosophical, psychological, and physiological approaches.</p><p><br></p><p>View information for the <a href=\"https://catalog.csustan.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=35&amp;ent_oid=1730\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Computer Science</a>, including Learning Objectives for the department and its programs.</p>"

        "<p>Ethnic Studies is a transdisciplinary field that provides critical, intersectional, and decolonial approaches to the study of racism and racialization. The program centers histories, contemporary experiences, and cultural expressions of Native American/Indigenous people, Black/African Americans, Chicano/a/xs-Latino/a/xs, and Asian/Pacific Islander Americans within a regional, national, and/or global context. The Ethnic Studies curriculum, which incorporates scholarship, art, and community engagement, provides students with critical inquiry that advances their analysis of racial privilege and oppression in relation to other axes of power, such as class, gender, sexuality, and legal status. In particular, the major provides students with a critical understanding of structural inequities and social movements in the United States and beyond in order to actively engage personal and collective transformation. A degree in Ethnic Studies is relevant to a variety of fields, including: education, business, law, health, social services, community organizations, and/or the arts. Ethnic Studies faculty are dedicated to producing critical/creative scholarship, teaching and mentoring marginalized students, and working toward social change.</p><p><br></p><p>View information for the <a href=\"https://catalog.csustan.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=35&amp;ent_oid=1735\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Ethnic Studies</a>.</p>"

        "<p>The Gender Studies major will provide students with an interdisciplinary, liberal arts education that will support them in a wide range of careers and enhance their ability to participate actively in diverse communities. By design, the major emphasizes critical investigation of gender theory and research, historical and contemporary experiences, multiethnic and transnational understanding, and applied learning. Gender Studies examines how ideologies regarding sex, gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity and expression have influenced and been influenced by institutions, political and cultural practices, scientific and technological advancement, artistic expressions, belief systems, and work and social environments. Students explore and evaluate the intersections of gendered identities with such categories as race/ethnicity, economic class, age, ablebodiedness, religion, nationality and geographic location. In addition, students pursuing a Gender Studies major will graduate with strong critical thinking skills, extensive experience with oral and written communication, experience applying their knowledge through community-based and research projects, experiences working as part of diverse teams, and an appreciation for civic engagement. It is possible to complete the major requirements in a hybrid or online format.</p><p><br></p><p>View information for the <a href=\"https://catalog.csustan.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=35&amp;ent_oid=1726\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Sociology, Gerontology, and Gender Studies</a>, including Learning Objectives for the department and its programs.</p>",

        "<p>The Geography &amp; Environmental Resources Bachelor of Science offers an integrative perspective on the relations among social, political, economic, and biophysical processes that affect interconnections between people, environments, and places starting with a 25 unit upper-division core. Students then select one or more areas of concentration to complete the major: Applied Geography (12 units) or Environmental Resources (15 units). The major prepares students for a variety of careers and/or advanced study by educating them about Earth’s patterns and processes and their social, economic, and resource context. It also provides students with an array of technical skills and sustainable methods that have practical application for examining key issues facing society, resource use, and the environment. Students will be prepared for a variety of fields including geospatial technology, urban and regional planning, transportation, sustainable development, natural resource management, public health, marketing, tourism, international business, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations.</p><p><br></p><p>Experiential learning, community engagement, and service learning are hallmarks of the program. Additionally, the program strongly supports field and international educational experiences and encourages students to investigate opportunities for fieldwork and overseas study. Certain study abroad courses, offered through the CSU International Programs, are equivalent to courses in Geography &amp; Environmental Resources and may be used to fulfill requirements for degree options.</p><p><br></p><p>View information for the <a href=\"https://catalog.csustan.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=35&amp;ent_oid=1718\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Anthropology and Geography/Environmental Resources</a>, including Learning Objectives for the department and its programs.</p>",

        "<p>The Musical Theatre B.A. prepares undergraduates as Musical Theatre performers and backstage technicians. The curriculum emphasizes courses that offer hands-on training, with additional courses that provide comprehensive theatre and music theory. These courses are closely related to the department’s four seasonal productions, performed in the 300-seat mainstage theatre, the 80seat studio theatre, and the amphitheater. Graduates of the program will have a broad understanding of all aspects of theatre and theatre production, and the practical ability to be a musical theatre artist, with training in acting, singing, dancing, reading music, script and song analysis, and auditioning. Discipline, a collaborative ethic, and the ability to effectively organize are additional, valuable skills that graduates of the program will gain.</p><p><br></p><p>View information for the <a href=\"https://catalog.csustan.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=35&amp;ent_oid=1704\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Theatre</a>, including Learning Objectives for the department and its programs.</p>",

        "<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Stanislaus State accepts a maximum of 70 semester units of credit from two-year colleges. Students may complete additional lower-division courses to satisfy General Education requirements at the community colleges. However, the units will not count towards Stanislaus State minimum units to graduate (120 semester units.) It is recommended that nursing majors complete nine of the lower-division G.E. units at Stanislaus State concurrently, or after transfer, so they will meet graduation requirements. Possible choices include General Education Area C Humanities (at least 6 semester units), and Area D Social, Economic, and Political Institutions and Human Behavior (at least 3 semester units).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS TO THE UPPER DIVISION NURSING MAJOR</strong></p><p>Students seeking to enter the program must have:</p><ol><li>Active, unrestricted, California RN license with no disciplinary action pending or imposed,</li><li>Completed 60 semester units of baccalaureate-level transferable college credit,</li><li>Completed an AD or Diploma in nursing with a grade of C or better in each course,</li><li>The prerequisites must be completed prior to admission as indicated below,</li><li>Gained admission to the University with an overall grade point average of 2.00 or better, and</li><li>Enrollment of coursework is contingent upon documentation of a physical exam and on passing a drug screening and a background check.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>For information about admission to the Nursing B.S.: RN to BSN Track refer to the <a href=\"https://catalog.csustan.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=35&amp;poid=7928&amp;returnto=6777\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nursing B.S.:RN to BSN</a> section of the <a href=\"http://catalog.csustan.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Academic Catalog</a>.</p>",

        "<p>The Philosophy curriculum stresses development of critical reasoning skills at all stages of coursework. The Philosophy program cultivates the skills required to engage in the careful reading and analysis of original philosophical texts, and emphasizes the study of writings that have historical significance (drawing from the ancient Greek and modern European traditions). The Philosophy curriculum focuses considerable attention on recent developments in Continental Philosophy (including phenomenology, hermeneutics, and postmodern approaches to philosophical genealogy and deconstruction).</p><p><br></p><p>Through a discussion of the guiding ideas in these texts, students gain historical perspective on the evolution of our cultural traditions. They also gain critical perspective on the operative assumptions that ground our sense of cultural and personal identity in a rapidly changing world. Central issues raised in these courses concern the relation of judgment to moral evaluation, subjective perspective to the desire for objective understanding, language-games to discourses of power (including critical perspectives on metaphysical discourses), and critical approaches to the study and assessment of art, literature, and cultural values.</p><p><br></p><p>Many of our Philosophy courses focus on challenges and opportunities facing a multicultural society, including issues relating to self-development, cultural diversity, and the impetus to agree on shared principles as a basis for preserving or enhancing a sense of community. Philosophy also discusses the contingencies underwriting judgments that give privilege to some values over others, or serve to legitimize some voices at the expense of others. Philosophy courses promote careful discussion of the relevance of intellectual ideas and positions. Philosophical study emphasizes the practice of sound reasoning techniques as a basis for discerning and defending philosophical positions. Philosophy also emphasizes reflective analysis of implications that follow from principled commitments.</p><p><br></p><p>Studies in Philosophy offer excellent preparation for advanced studies in Philosophy, Law, Literary Criticism, Counseling Practices, and Rhetoric Studies.</p><p><br></p><p>View information for the <a href=\"https://catalog.csustan.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=35&amp;ent_oid=1724\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Philosophy and Modern Languages</a>, including Learning Objectives for the department and its programs.</p>"

In addition to a firm grounding in basic psychology, the concentration extends psychological principles to various aspects of human development.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://catalog.csustan.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=35&amp;poid=7874\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Experimental Psychology Concentration</strong></a></p><p>The Experimental Psychology concentration is tailored for the undergraduate psychology major who intends to pursue graduate training in the area of experimental or clinical psychology. It provides a strong background in the area of statistics and experimental methodology, which are two areas required for admission by psychology graduate schools. In addition to methodology, the student is exposed to a greater breadth of content areas in the field of experimental psychology than is required by the major. Finally, the student is provided with technical skills that greatly enhance the ability to conduct independent research, a requirement of graduate programs.</p>",

This program is approved by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing in Sacramento. Other public or private universities, such as Chapman and National, also require this or an equivalent CCTC-approved teacher credential subject matter preparation program.</p><p><br></p><p>In addition to this or an equivalent credential subject matter preparation program, students must complete a bachelor’s degree.

Those who pass do not need to complete this or any other credential preparation program to be accepted into a single subject credential program for social sciences. Exam fee, testing dates, and more information is available at the Stanislaus State Credential Processing Center in DBH 303 (on the Stanislaus State Turlock Campus), or by calling (209) 667-3534.</p><p><br></p><p>Students planning to complete this program must contact the Coordinator of Social Sciences for advisement and an evaluation of courses taken elsewhere that may satisfy requirements.

        "<p>Sociology is the scientific study of human social interaction and institutions. From its origin in nineteenth-century industrializing Europe, sociology developed as a methodologically rigorous, empirically based analysis of social structure. The study of Sociology provides students with a rewarding academic experience as well as a variety of career possibilities. Recent graduates of the department have applied their training to enter prestigious graduate schools or to obtain entry-level management and administrative positions with such varied organizations as large and small businesses; criminal justice agencies; child welfare organizations; local welfare and mental health departments, the criminal courts, and social service agencies.</p><p><br></p><p>Sociology majors receive a strong grounding in traditional and contemporary social theory, methods of conducting social research, and techniques of analyzing social data. Students can select elective courses from areas including social institutions such as the family, religion, and medicine, and social processes such as social change, social deviance, personality and society, and drug use.</p><p><br></p><p>View information for the <a href=\"https://catalog.csustan.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=35&amp;ent_oid=1726\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Sociology, Gerontology, and Gender Studies</a> including Learning Objectives for the department and its programs.</p>",
